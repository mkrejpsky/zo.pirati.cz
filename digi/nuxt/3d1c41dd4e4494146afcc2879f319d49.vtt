00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Education in the quarantine

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good afternoon to all of you,
welcome to the Going Digital.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Specifically, at the discussion panel
about quarantine, distance or digital education.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.600
Before we get to the actual discussion
and introduction of guests,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.400
allow me a few words about
the organization of the panel.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100
The panel will be divided into two parts,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.600
in the first part we will discuss three sub-topics,
all related to quarantine education.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Specifically, we will be talking
about the so-called digital divide

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.400
in the context of the ongoing
global covid-19 pandemic.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.600
Then, we will be concerned
with the question of education reform.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.200
Is it needed to reform
education in the Czech Republic

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.700
in connection with the current pandemic.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.780
Next sub-topic,
that we called the "clash of generations",

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:58.200
Do young teachers and young students

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.800
actually clash there with the older generation
in the context of digital education?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.300
In the second part,
it's time for your questions,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
which you can send them in chat
during the discussion.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.080
So if, at any time during the discussion,
you have a question for some of the guests

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.000
do not hesitate to ask.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.000
And last but not least, I would ask you
to turn off your microphones and webcams.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.000
The whole discussion should last
maximum of 60 minutes.

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:31.800
Before we move on to the discussion,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.800
let me welcome Mr. Adam Lalák,
who is the head of research at Scio schools,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.300
where he focuses on innovative education
or alternative ways of education.

00:01:45.297 --> 00:01:46.297
Good afternoon

00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:51.850
Then welcome Mr. Josef Kundrát,
who is not physically with us, but at least online,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.800
who works at the Faculty of Arts of the
University of Ostrava, at the Department of Psychology.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.910
In his field he deals with the psychology
of education or alternative education.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.234
Good afternoon Mr. Kundrat.

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:10.224
Hello everyone, I hope you can hear me.

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:12.334
Yes, we can hear you well.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.900
Next, please welcome Mr. Štěpán Kment,
who is an analyst at EDUin,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.300
Information Center for Education

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.500
and is also a co-author of the
revision of the Czech education system.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.750
Good afternoon.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.222
Hello, I probably wouldn't say
that I am a co-author,

00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:31.292
but somehow I participated.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.600
So you are involved in the revision.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.900
Next I welcome Mrs. Petra Mazancová,
a teacher from the Josef Jungmann grammar school

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.500
and at the same time, chairwoman of the
Teachers platform. Welcome here.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.690
Good afternoon.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.620
And last but not least,
I welcome Mrs. Jana Urbanová,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.100
English teacher who has experience
from a language school

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.510
and a primary school in Prague. Good afternoon

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.150
Good afternoon.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.200
Why do we have the topic of digital education

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.000
or quarantine education at this conference

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.540
which concerns the digital agenda?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.800
This is obvious, because the coronavirus
pandemic forced us to move

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.160
from full-time education to distance learning.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.000
It forced us to use more of digital
technologies for educational purposes,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.400
Specifically the Internet
and various Internet platforms.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600
In this regard, we should ask,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.490
has the Czech Republic managed
this transition to distance education?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.000
What are we lagging behind

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.200
and what, on the contrary,
has succeeded or what has failed?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.300
Mr Lalák, can you comment on whether
the Czech Republic has been successful,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.800
if we take into account the forced
transition to distance learning?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I have a feeling that the success rate
was not completely high,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.400
especially in the first wave of the pandemic,
it was really very difficult.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.800
In fact, thousands of children were not
connected to the distance learning at all.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.390
Entire schools and entire regions had
great difficulties adapting to this.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.900
I think it revealed several things
about the Czech education system.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.710
The first, important thing is that,
it showed the great rigidity of that system,

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.890
Which we already knew about.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.640
The educational school system has really
been going on the same way for decades.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.450
Just few things are changing.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.520
There are few changes. There are small demands
on teachers to adapt to new things.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.500
We have never had such an experience here
that we would have to adapt something quickly.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.900
Unlike, for example,
the countries of Southeast Asia,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.840
where they already experienced a pandemic
17 years ago

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.400
and those schools
have since been much more flexible

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.200
and were systematically preparing
for such shocks in the system.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.900
At the same time, it can be seen
that the system is terribly bureaucratic.

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.700
There is too much legislation and regulation,
which reduces flexibility

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.400
and the ability of the system
to face new challenges.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.100
For example, in order to become a teacher
in the Czech Republic,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.800
one must graduate from the Faculty of Education
or have a pedagogical education.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.500
The system is terribly impermeable,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.500
and those people who teach there,
usually do the same thing all their lives,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.667
often still teaching only at that one school.
They are not flexible

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:24.700
I would dare to speculate,
although I do not have the data,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.450
that people who teach at school
and have worked in some other work before,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.030
so they managed to adapt better in this aspect,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.300
but we just do not have so many
those people in the Czech Republic.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.350
And then it showed other things
about the Czech education system.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.000
I think there was a big failure in the management
of those schools,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.150
because school principals are often primarily
educators and not so good managers.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.300
They couldn't make sure that the teachers
worked really well in this new regime.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.600
At the same time, it showed inequalities
in the Czech education, we will get to that later.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.600
There are huge differences between
schools across the Czech Republic.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.000
You might encounter on the so-called digital
divide which actually showed itself.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.100
The pandemic showed the digital divide
not only in the Czechia, but in whole Europe.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.400
What the digital divide actually means?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.150
It is a situation
where some have access to quality internet,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.600
have digital skills, the necessary hardware equipment
but others do not.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.600
Štěpán Kment and now I would like to address you,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.900
do you see the issue of digital divide,
as a problem in the Czechia?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.200
How big is this problem
and how would you solve it?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
There are available OECD data,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.800
which found out if kids have computer
and an internet connection.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.900
If I remember correctly, the number of children
who did not have the equipment

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.100
was about five percent,
but here we have to talk about

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.400
if those children who answered
"yes I have a computer at home"

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.400
so if they shared it
with one, two, three siblings.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.500
Naturally, if the siblings were also
required by the school for such distance learning,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.200
it caused problems when they had to
somehow take turns with the device,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.900
especially during synchronous lessons
, lessons which are held online.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.800
In the post that
I filmed for your conference last night,

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:40.000
I mentioned that the Czech education system
has one such disgrace,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.100
I named it as a disgrace in data collection

00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:48.700
Namely, that the Czech educational system
is not able to identify the needful pupils

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.700
and it actually does it as intuitively

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.080
For example,
school inspectorates ascertained successful strategies

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.000
for educating socioeconomically
disadvantaged students.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.900
And in order to select these students,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.300
it actually cooperated with teachers
and principals to be able to identify them.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.620
It seems pretty unreal to me,
it seems incredible to me, it is very bad.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.800
I gave an example from Great Britain
where eligibility for free lunch,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.400
shows that the child is needful.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.150
And the fact that we did not have any such
indicator at the beginning of the pandemic.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:33.700
We had no indication that this is a child
who needs more resources for education,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.800
because of course we have known for decades

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that children who come from, simply said,
from worse families.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.000
Education is more difficult for them,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.460
due to less cultural capital,
less family support and so on.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.100
And when we entered to the pandemic
without knowing

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.600
who are these children and especially in
which schools they are being educated,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.890
Typically if the school, for example,
has a catchment area

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:09.000
and saying the school is attended by
40% of children who are eligible for free lunch,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.410
Now giving an analogous example
from Great Britain,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.250
Then we know that this school
needs significantly more resources,

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:21.950
it needs much more care, it needs more support
and teachers are incredibly busier.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:27.500
They are much busier than teachers
who teach in schools

00:09:27.515 --> 00:09:31.800
which middle class children attend.
If I simplify it.

00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:37.182
So, I see the unpreparedness
of the Czech system in this.

00:09:37.382 --> 00:09:40.022
I see it in the fact that we don't even know
what we don't have.

00:09:41.222 --> 00:09:48.882
Then we just lament that there are inequalities
and we lack any tools to solve them.

00:09:49.082 --> 00:09:53.800
And I think
we place uneven demands on teachers and schools,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.900
because every teacher naturally has to meet
a different type of pupil,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.140
but this educational policy does not
actually reflect that.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.350
Now it is time to turn directly to people
who work directly in schools.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.300
Petro Mazancová, you are a grammar school teacher
and the chairwoman of the Teachers platform,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.230
Do you agree with what was said here?

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.920
or how do you perceive the digital divide
in the Czech Republic?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.000
I understand that we are at a Pirate conference

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.890
and the digital divide sounds
tempting and attractive.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:31.800
But we have the divie mainly because
not every child has access to a good school.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.450
The fate in the Czech Republic,
yours and yours' child

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.700
depends very much on
how good is the school you go to.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:45.400
Currently, it is a catchment school,
or a school that your parents chose for you,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.280
because they had enough cultural, economic,
social background to be able to choose.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.550
And they were able to do something,
so you can attend the better school.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.300
So, in my opinion, the biggest problem
of the Czech Republic in terms of education

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.800
is the significant differences
between primary schools.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.200
The differences are huge
and the coronavirus crisis just showed it

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.470
We had it that way, but it was not visible

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:17.040
And now it's just too much visible,
how the approaches of those schools differ.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.320
Jana Urbanová,
do you have a similar opinion as a teacher ,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.790
who has experience from a language school
and primary school?

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.400
Do you see the digital divide?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.660
I will use that term.
It is a term commonly used for the this divide.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.800
Do you agree with your previous speaker
with what she said?

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:47.570
Certainly, as I have experience from public school
and from a private school,

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.500
I was doing distance learning
from a private school,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.950
where the equipment was very good,
and I think you can see big differences,

00:11:58.244 --> 00:12:00.054
not only between schools,

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:04.400
but also between individual children
and teachers, as they dealt with it.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.700
I will return to the question of
how the Czech Republic managed it,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.360
I wouldn't see it so badly.
I wouldn't say we didn't make it or did it wrong.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.450
But we did it a lot differently,
everyone handled it as he should.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.260
I must say, what we didn't do
very well was support from above,

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:28.000
some systematic support that
would help teachers to handle the situation.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.600
and I must say that although
they had almost zero support,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.700
I think the vast majority of them
handled it very well.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.750
Of course, there are exceptions
when someone didn't make it.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.330
But I think that, given the situation that arose

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.000
and how quickly we had to deal with it,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.050
and how little resources
and support we had from above,

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.400
it actually worked out very well.
Everyone did what he could.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.100
Mr. Kundrat, you as an academic psychologist,
who focuses on the psychology of education

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.900
and measuring the effectiveness of teaching.

00:12:56.835 --> 00:13:00.600
Have you noticed,
or are there data, or do you think

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.360
that the transition to distance learning
has had an adverse effect

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.750
on the effectiveness of education
and on the mental state of pupils and students?

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.020
Thank you, I don't have this data
for this at the moment.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.700
I can´t answer.
I don't have my answer based on research.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.679
I assume that the data will be created,

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:27.269
studies from the time of quarantine education
will be published.

00:13:27.469 --> 00:13:29.669
I think it had an adverse effect on everyone,

00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:33.320
the longer the situation is,
especially in the second wave.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.200
It's not just students and teachers,
we all experience it.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.200
It is necessary to agree with those
who have spoken before me,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.600
that it is vastly different that experience.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.060
Those who had good conditions from the start,
logically managed to do better

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.400
than those who are somehow disadvantaged.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:07.200
Within one school, there can be hundreds of
different stories of how these people did it,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.500
based on the conditions they had.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:18.250
I wouldn't go with the term digital divide,
I don't think that's one big problem

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.000
It is not one big situation
that has one big solution.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.900
I think that what is happening here
and the what pandemic revealed,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.000
is there are thousands of minor problems.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:39.600
Whether it is that in many families, pupils do not
have their own table where they can sit.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.830
Because they don't have work desks at home,

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.200
for example, they have sofa there,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.300
but it's not ergonomically good to sit there
all morning and work.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.000
Other people have a problem
with the Internet connection,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.600
someone who lives in the village
and is the last on the line,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.950
and when the neighbors in front of him start
downloading movies or high-volume data packets,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.500
the Internet simply slows down.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:14.320
In another case, it may be the teacher
who does not have a good connection.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.000
So I wouldn't see the digital divide as
one crucial thing that can be solved,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.430
but more like the thousands of little pains
that just need to be taken away one by one.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.430
The longer it lasts,
the more differences between those

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.440
who have the equipment
and do not, just deepen.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.550
This brings us to the next point,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.580
and that is actually how to change it
and what to do,

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.900
because it has been said here so far,
so it does not seem to be a problem

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:45.700
only in the education system,
but it is also related to social problems.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.200
And not only when it comes to education,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.050
but also when it comes to the
background of families and so on.

00:15:51.085 --> 00:15:55.750
Štěpán Kment, as you said,
you participated in the revision.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.340
Possible revision of the education
system in the Czech Republic.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.000
So can you outline what you came up with?

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:13.200
What path should we take to deal
with this situation, we are talking.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:20.070
I probably need to explain my involvement
in the preparation of the 2030 strategy.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:25.000
I participated in the writing of the background document

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.001
"Main directions of educational policy"

00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:33.341
when I worked at the Ministry of Education
last year for six months.

00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:37.310
But I'm definitely not in a position
to answer that question.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:43.700
It is a political question that you should
probably ask the Minister of Education

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.600
or, for example,
someone from the school committee.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.200
What is in the Strategy of
Educational policy until 2030,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:02.600
is that inequalities should be reduced
by reducing differences in quality of schools.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.600
By introducing the so-called
middle link of support,

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.010
it means that the differences between schools
in the territory are balanced,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.600
or that there is someone called a superintendent,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.350
a person who would monitor the quality
of schools and provide the right support.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.300
So that's the side of support
and then that side of accountability

00:17:26.442 --> 00:17:30.000
that are always such 2 mainstreams push-pull.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:39.000
In education, it is proposed through nodal points
when the ministry expects to test children.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.500
It is not yet 100% clear whether it will be
mass testing, even if it looks like it,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.780
pupils in the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 7th and 9th grades.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:55.500
This data should provide information
on how schools are performing,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:02.700
ideally if we are able to match that data
with other demographic indicators,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.330
if we have good personnel capacity
in managing the system,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:14.800
If there are qualified people, then
they can tell which schools perform worse,

00:18:14.842 --> 00:18:21.300
and of course now there is the disclaimer
*the test measures just something*,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.500
tests do not measure how teachers work,
for example, on the character of students,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.720
how they work on some of their soft skills.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.710
Mr. Lalák can certainly add to
how many things SCIO schools teach,

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.900
but test will not reflect it.

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:43.700
I think that Petra Mazancová while teaching English
also developing children in way,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.400
that written tests can not capture.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:56.300
This is the entry of that educational policy
into that of the current decades, 2020s.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.800
as the Ministry of Education imagines
that it will reduce inequality,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.980
and thus in the first three years more
focusing on selected regions,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.700
where educational results are,
at least according to Pisa testing, the lowest

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.000
In comparison with other regions in the country,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.200
it is the Karlovy Vary
and Ústí nad Labem regions,

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.300
so there would be other
special measures in 2021 to 2023.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.220
Thank you. I can already
see the questions coming in the chat,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.540
be sure to keep asking
and in a moment we'll get to them.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.500
Now I would return back a little,
more to that digital dimension.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.250
Mr Lalák, with regard to greater
involvement of digital technologies in education,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.400
not only in the context of a pandemic
but in the future, in the 21st century.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.910
Do you think it is necessary
and important for the future to

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.560
place more emphasis on students digital skills?

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.000
And do you think that in the future is necessary

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.400
to count on with more frequent distance learning?
And is it even desirable?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.800
Definitely yes, that is without a doubt.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Like it or not, many of us spend most of our
working lives somewhere at the computer,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.900
We are sitting in the office
and working in a virtual environment,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.600
and it is simply appropriate for the schools
to prepare the children for it in some way,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.000
and digital resources need to be more
integrated into that school environment.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.400
I think that working more with
distance learning in the future

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.800
will definitely be needed as well.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.060
Basically, one of the things we have learned
from distance learning in 2020,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:47.200
is that distance learning is not so bad
and there are certain types of people,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.600
whether they are pupils with special needs,
more introverted pupils

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.600
or very gifted pupils
who need study at their own pace.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.000
These are the students,
whom this distance learning method,

00:21:04.028 --> 00:21:06.800
where they organize the timetable
and lessons themselves. suits more.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.200
And I think we should work with it more
and at the same time prepare those people

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.999
for the future
where it will be necessary to quickly adapt

00:21:17.199 --> 00:21:18.955
to various unexpected changes in the system

00:21:19.155 --> 00:21:22.090
and it will be necessary for these people
to be more independent

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.999
and have greater digital literacy.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.200
Definitely we should start integrating
more distance learning

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.000
into the normal functioning of our schools.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.600
and one example of how SCIO reacted
to this, is the Expeditionary School.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.400
I talked about it in my post, which is a new
model that we are currently testing.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.000
School where distance online teaching
is for three weeks a month

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.000
and the fourth week children are taught
physically through some experiential expedition.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.800
It is one of many models and I think
that we should try to come up with more such models,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.150
test what works, what suits to whom,
to what demographic group

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.450
and proceed in this direction.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.700
Petra Mazancová, do you agree with this?

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.400
Because when I ask teachers in ordinary
schools about distance learning,

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.300
not that they would have a problem
that they could not handle it,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.750
but according to them, it is simply not
as effective as regular full-time teaching.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.030
Do you think that in the future we should
involve more distance learning?

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.330
Distance and digital education.
These are two different things, but ok.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.070
I think that mainly
the narrative of society is not set up well.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.760
From the beginning, we just keep talking
about getting the kids back to school,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.800
let's get them back there quickly,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.850
because what's going on at home right now,
isn't right.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.440
I'm really outraged by such talks.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.670
I'm tired of reacting to it.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.720
I don't mean this conference
and this panel right now,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.800
but it is so, and such a discourse in the sense

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.900
"A lost generation of children grows up"

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.880
which will be maximally affected by not
going to school for 6 months

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.900
When you notice that it is simply the mainstream
that goes in that public space

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.500
and it is very difficult to react to it.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.400
The distance learning can simply be good,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.100
it just depends on the specific school.
So it can be done well.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.600
We have to overcome the narrative that is now
here that distance learning

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.800
will always be bad, and it's just a substitute for
not being able to go to school right now.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.800
It can be very effective,
but we have to learn it.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.620
Just as pupils and students learn it,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.735
so do teachers and schools have to learn it.

00:23:44.935 --> 00:23:52.825
So the future is in learning and not forgeting,
that during crises we managed a lot.

00:23:53.025 --> 00:23:55.750
As teachers we were able to
learn a lot and move a lot.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:04.100
We moved and learned more things
than any time, during all the entire career path.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.700
All my colleagues
or the absolute majority of my colleagues

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.330
keep the elements of the distance education
even at a time when

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.300
they are already needed in full-time teaching..

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:20.800
They keep their digital classes open
and simply work with children and students

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
in a similar way as they were working
during that distance learning.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.900
This means the trend of learning to work
with it is, in my opinion, crucial,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.330
and I hope that we will keep it,
but it is really the public discourse.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.670
Think how many petitions we had
in sense of returning children to schools,

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:42.000
the pressure on the Ministry of Education
and the Ministry of Health

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.360
in this direction was enormous.

00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:48.000
I don't know if it was actually deliberated..

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.850
Instead of focusing on
how to improve distance learning,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:56.400
we focused on returning to full-time
as soon as possible. I think it's a shame

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.100
Thank you,
you're right, we should use the term distance learning

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.800
rather than digital, because this part of panel
is mainly about distance learning.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.200
Jana Urbanová the same question to you
as a teacher from practice,

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.300
What is your experience with distance learning?

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.380
And do you think it's good to put more
emphasis on it in the future,

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.500
and we shouldn't be as afraid of it as
we ever hear in that mainstream?

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.800
I think that purely distance learning
is reserved for those special occasions,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.800
such as pandemics or crisis situations.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.200
It could certainly be a way, an alternative
approach, but it would not be for everyone

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.800
It's the same as with any unusual method,
to someone it suits more, someone less.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.800
Both among teachers and among children.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.200
And I can imagine
that there are a lot of children and teachers,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.800
who could be educated in this way primarily.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.900
But even
where it would not be directly in this form,

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:03.800
it is worth taking at least some elements
involve them in that "normal teaching".

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.600
After we return to the old ways,
combined teaching will still have its future.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.700
Mr Kunrát, you have already touched
on this topic in your introductory speech.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.005
So briefly, in your opinion, is distance learning

00:26:19.205 --> 00:26:22.000
and a greater emphasis
on distance learning desirable?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.200
I would agree with the other speakers,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.000
I will take it from
the point of view of college teacher.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:36.500
And if we do not stick only to the idea of
distance learning in primary and secondary schools.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.330
So I can absolutely imagine
that within universities,

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:45.750
the distance lectures can fully
replace full-time teaching.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.000
Of course, seminars
and exercises are something else.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.600
There the personal contact is irreplaceable.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:02.870
But I can imagine that a lot of students
may have trouble with commuting

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:08.000
and with balancing work duties and studying.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.770
So they can attend lectures remotely,
without these problems.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:21.350
Of course, the younger the pupils and are,
the harder it would be to fully replace it.

00:27:21.366 --> 00:27:26.000
However, I agree that some elements
should be retained.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:33.300
Mainly because our and global
society is in a unique situation.

00:27:33.328 --> 00:27:38.200
I can't imagine what would happen if
there was no pandemic in 2020, and we announced

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.930
that we will move to half a year of online
education as part of an experiment.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.000
I can't imagine the reactions of the
professional public to this

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.200
Now we have been forced into such a situation.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.200
And it would be a pity to leave the "best"
thing that the situation offered us,

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:01.700
that we were looking for new ways, to leave
it completely and return it to normal.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.700
I agree with my colleague Urbanova on this.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.000
Such an observation I have about it,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.300
every teacher has some cognitive
resources, he has some capacity.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.500
The more students in the class,
the more difficult it is for him to pay attention

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.770
to everyone, whether in person
or in distance learning.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:32.550
I would like to suggest that full-time and
distance learning could be more effective

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:38.000
if we could reduce
the number of pupils in the classroom.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:44.800
This means having more teachers
or learning better to use assistants.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000
My experience is that many teachers
cannot use the full potential of assistants.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.120
And nowadays, it could turn out to have
something like a digital assistant,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.000
or have a pedagogical assistant for
distance learning, that can run in parallel

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.000
with the full-time one,
it could be beneficial.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.750
For example, for students who are slightly ill
and unable to attend school,

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:14.500
or for some reason they are educated remotely.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.500
In the future, this could be one of the ways

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:25.600
Better using of assistants and,
if possible, fewer pupils in the classroom.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.520
But this is an opinion that must be
evaluated by teachers who teach

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.600
who are teaching in those primary
and secondary schools,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.200
not me from the position of a university teacher.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.200
Thank you, Mr Lalák, I would like to follow up,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.450
all the speakers agree that distance
learning is not a bad word

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.490
and we could use it more in the future.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.950
You as an expert who deals with
alternative ways of education

00:29:53.150 --> 00:30:00.000
Don't you feel any effects on students'
concentration when they are taught online?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.500
Doesn't that have a negative effect
on their concentration?

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.590
Well, I think it's definitely
more challenging in some ways

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.100
because indeed the distance learning
places slightly different demands

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.150
on each student, because he needs
to plan the lessons himself.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.150
He needs to decide what he will be doing.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.400
He needs to decide where he will be studying,

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.380
if he will be in the living room,
kitchen or bedroom.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:33.200
and there are a lot of things
that just put certain obstacles.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.700
But I think people can learn a lot from it.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:43.760
Distance learning is a very effective way
to develop some independence.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.100
This is called self-regulation of those students

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.450
It means somehow organizing their own time,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.250
because that is then the thing
they will use the most in their lives.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:59.250
So I think that even though
there may be some lower concentration,

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.200
it's useful for something, because those
people will learn to actively work

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:11.200
with lack of concentration and
somehow process it and overcome it.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.350
Thank you, I would now like
to turn to the third topic,

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.000
which I have named as a clash of generations

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.800
And now I would turn to teachers from practice.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.900
I would like to ask, technology is moving
forward at a tremendous speed

00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:33.200
and distance learning, requires some
practice and digital skills,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.200
and some work with technology and the Internet.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:43.400
But it can often be a problem for older teachers,
so I want to ask Petra Mazancová

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.630
and Jano Urbanova,
of course it's not your problem,

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:50.800
but you certainly know older educators
for whom it may be a problem

00:31:50.851 --> 00:31:55.500
to adapt to distance education,
I want to ask Mrs. Mazancová

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.500
if she has any colleagues who complain about it
and do not receive enough support

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.400
and it is difficult for them
to adapt to the situation.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.820
You've already answered, it's about the support

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:16.320
I know a few younger colleagues
who just don't want to do it

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.580
and I have the example of a 70-year-old
professor at our grammar school,

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:27.400
who was an understudy normally teaches French
online so well that children are excited.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.000
It's a bit of a cliché,
on the other hand we must realize

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.500
that the average age of a
Czech teacher is simply 50 years.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.400
That is a fact, that is how far we let it
go as sociaty, with not supporting teachers.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.800
It's just that the generation of teachers
has aged and it's all about the support.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.200
I'm the ICT coordinator at our school
and if you have a person who works well

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.200
in that school and can pass experience on to you

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.900
and he can help you when you need to turn
to him as a teacher, so nothing is problem.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:04.590
For example we are relatively rigid grammar
school in the Ústí nad Labem region,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:11.600
but all the teachers switched to online,
some easier, some with some difficulties,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:18.450
all were supported by principal and
people who knew it and could teach them,

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:25.760
but they managed it. So in my opinion,
the crucial thing is how well the school is run

00:33:25.773 --> 00:33:31.500
And how much it will support its teachers
in doing it.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.200
So I would definitely repeat
again that the cliché

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.100
the old don't want to have anything
to do with technology but the young

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.600
use two or three new applications every hour"

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.500
in my opinion doesn't apply at all

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.250
and it's just about some
willingness to lifelong learning.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:53.600
Be honest, some teachers dont
desire for lifelong learning

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.999
they have feeling, that once they graduated
from Faculty of Education at the age of 26,

00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:03.200
they dont need to learn anyting new.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.400
Thats's just a general problem,
not only with digital technologies.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.400
So I will definitely defend older teachers.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.100
We talked about some need for support
during the transition to distance education

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.000
and now I would ask Jana Urbanová,
because Mr. Karel Gargulák asks in the chat:

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.200
A question for a teacher from practice,

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.000
what do they think is the ideal support
for the transition to distance education

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.250
and in general about digital skills,
what schools were missing

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:39.150
and what was missing from the system as a whole?

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.150
I definitely think there are two levels.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:49.400
First, it is a long-term support for teachers
to be ready for such situations.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.000
And then about what was missing at that
moment, when did this situation arise.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.100
I think that what was missing
at the time this situation arose

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.880
was definitely some clear information.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.400
A quick decision to let us know what to do.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.400
At the beginning, no one really knew
anything and it was "somehow deal with it"

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:12.190
and it was the biggest problem.
So we shall come with changes, from day to day.

00:35:12.709 --> 00:35:19.300
And I think, this was'nt just about
clash of generations, I completely agree with

00:35:19.387 --> 00:35:22.000
that it's not so that older teachers
have a problem with technologies

00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:26.500
and younger ones don't.
But suddenly is something wanted,

00:35:23.028 --> 00:35:32.400
from day to day, with minimal support
or information on how to achieve this.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.560
So I missed this, clear instructions
on what to do here.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.700
Even from the beginning, no one knew
if we should teach all subjects,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.450
whether we should also assign tasks
from physical education or not,

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.200
In fact, the information was very unclear
from the beginning.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.310
And that's why the beginning of spring
was so stressful for everyone.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:57.450
In the long term, I think it is a good
long-term training for teachers,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.900
which would be easily accessible and made sense,

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.450
because, as my colleague Mazancová said,
many teachers are not even interested in it

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.000
and those who are, often come across the fact

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.300
that those available courses do not
have much benefit in practice

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.500
and they do not see much meaning
in those courses.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.000
So I understand that people who want to
continue their education are discouraged

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.800
by going to a few courses like that and find out
that it didn't give them much into practice.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Mr. Karel Gargulák follows up on his question
and I would address it to Mr. Kundrát,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.700
it has perhaps a bit of a philosophical nature.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.300
What should the teacher know,

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.900
what requirements meet, for distance learning,
modern teaching?

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:52.040
What should he be like? Do you think,
that to gain those teachers, we need to create

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.500
new educational programs
or change the whole system?

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.500
Personally, I believe that a good
teacher a hundred years ago

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:05.540
and a good teacher today should
have more or less similar skill sets.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.500
Let's remember the good teachers
who were teaching us, when we were in primary

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.000
or in secondary school.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.350
They were a role models for us,
they passed values to us,

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:25.000
they valued us in some way as students,
and they were willing

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.150
to do something more, one extra mile.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:34.500
Simply said, people with whom we felt good.

00:37:34.563 --> 00:37:44.000
And for me, if the teacher has these
characteristics and is integrated personality,

00:37:44.015 --> 00:37:45.015
ot doesn't matter if he teaches via a webcam
or if he is with the pupils in person

00:37:45.215 --> 00:37:50.800
it won't matter if he teaches via a webcam
or if he is with the pupils in person.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.100
This is really the medium which we can work with.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:03.000
So the core just has to stay good,
a mature personality who just wants to do it,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.600
person who is close to those students

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.430
and a quality teacher-student relationship
can be established there.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.900
And whether the situation will be
implemented via the Internet

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.400
or simply face-to-face, that's a bit of
a secondary question, I think.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.600
Of course where to find the teacher now?

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.450
I'm looking in the chat,
I think it's really necessary to start

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:27.500
with those pedagogical faculties, with
education of these teachers and the system.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.750
but these are questions
that I really do not know if is it good to ask

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.120
to an educational psychologist,

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.000
these are questions that are good
to point to the establishment.

00:38:37.034 --> 00:38:40.450
How to actually work with the system
of teacher education?

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.000
Maybe I would like to comment
on what has been said here before.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.000
I recently came across a team that I really liked and it was "digital clumsiness".

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.450
It's not a term that would
mean as a rejection of technology

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:59.000
or something like a rigid attitude
"I won't teach online, it's just for the young".

00:38:59.999 --> 00:39:05.769
The experience is that a lot of those teachers
just want, but they are not as familiar

00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:13.300
to the online / digital world as,
for example, those younger colleagues

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.200
or as the students.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:24.130
They need to be supported and with some
care they overcome this digital clumsiness.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:28.500
And these are often quite simple
issues that are easy to solved

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.600
but in the overall context, they just
need the systematicall support.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.500
As it said before, I wouldn't look for the problem
in the willingness of those people,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:45.600
but I return to what I said in the beginning,
small solutions of small problems,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:56.300
that the practice simply brings and the possibilities
to help overcome these little troubles.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.290
Thank you, we have more and more
questions, now from Václav Kubaljak.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.000
Perhaps I would ask Mr Štěpán Kment.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.750
This year, the Ministry of Education
distributed 1.3 billion CZK

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.290
for technology to primary schools.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.500
It was supposed to be
about 20,000 CZK per full-time teacher,

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.400
do you perceive this investment as sufficient?

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.400
I am asking you because you have some
experience with the Ministry of Education

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.110
and the National Institute for
Education and with the revision,

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.000
so what do you think about that?

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.350
Well, I certainly can't stand up
for the institutions you mentioned.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:39.300
However, here we need to consider
whether the money went where it was needed,

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.400
respectively ,if I'm not mistaken,
the money went to elementary schools

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.100
did not go to high school and we have to ask

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:55.600
f the children who really needet
this equipment, if they got it?

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.400
then arises a question
when the money came to the schools at all,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:06.000
And if the schools were able to buy
adequate equipment with the money.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.400
So here is few questions which we need to ask.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:19.500
All planning was also very weird.
The Ministry of Education rushed in very late,

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.000
they werent dealith with it during summer,
when schools had time to buy it,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.600
identify their needs and
report it to the ministry.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.760
As Petra Mazancova writes in the chat,
it should not be widespread with small amounts,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.222
some schools need much more
and some dont need even one device.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.460
So I am returning to the disgrace
of the Czech education system,

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:49.900
that we don't even know which schools
are more needed, which need more resources

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.120
we have no way to find out.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.000
It is simply not a priority for us
and it is the biggest problem.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:06.400
For example, today's panel would look
completely different if we had one indicator.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:12.400
One mark that we could assign to schools,
pupils and we knew

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.870
that these schools in some territory
are simply more needfull

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.045
and we are directing money to them
and directing funds to them.

00:42:20.245 --> 00:42:26.800
I would like to return a bit to the debate
that was about the portability

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
and usability of distance learning
after a pandemic or, in short,

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.600
during the normal functioning of schools

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.400
I think we should not forget that schools
are like a safe haven for children

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:48.970
and that they provide not only the academic side, but also the pastoral care.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:53.600
Teachers have many social roles that
they simply can't fulfill online, it's impossible.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.710
The child can hardly write to the teacher

00:42:56.814 --> 00:42:58.600
"please set aside five minutes for me on Zoom,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.200
I want to tell you
that I am not actually well at home,

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.080
and something bad is happening to me".

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.450
And it is often these moments
when a teacher who has trust of children,

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:13.800
hears during the break that something
unfair is happening, whether it is bullying,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
whether it is some neglect at home

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.800
and has the opportunity to be the
first contact for the child.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.500
It is important to recognize
this social function of the school or teacher,

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:36.700
The Pandemic Pedagogy, that I have read myself,
is incredibly beneficial.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.500
But there are other roles that the school
will fill and that we should not forget.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.000
PetroaMazancová, I have noticed
that you agree that it is difficult

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.500
almost impossible in this situation
detect the shortcomings in schools.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.700
Is it really so and how to get out of it?

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.500
So how to detect shortcomings?

00:43:55.488 --> 00:43:57.800
Where to direct support?

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:05.000
I just wanted to respond to Štěpán
about the social function of the teacher.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.750
I would like to say that of course
it is absolutely essential,

00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:15.100
on the other hand, in that pandemic
if you had a normal relation with those children,

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.300
so you found a lot of other ways
how those children can communicate with you.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:25.150
I really dealt with a lot of crisis
interventions through chat,

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:29.300
which I would probably never do,
but it's a question

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.200
if the children came in person
or if using the chat wasn't easier

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.200
and more attractive for them at that moment.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.800
They didn't have to look at me,
to look me in the eyes

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.600
when they said something that wasn't pleasant.

00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:48.350
Of course it doesn't work
at the first stage of elementary school,

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:53.500
but at the second stage
and in our grammar school it worked very well.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.700
And it is reflected to a large extent
but of course

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.404
this presupposes a relations already
created during full-time teaching

00:44:58.604 --> 00:45:02.700
or the steduent saw the teacher
before they went home during the pandemic.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.200
I'm sorry but can you repeat the question
what you asked

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.300
and I responded to Štěpán instead?

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.300
Yes, Štěpán Kment mentioned
that there are no data at all.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.220
We do not know how to find out
which schools have what shortcomings

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.300
and where to direct support which they lack.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.900
Is that really so and how to solve it?

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.000
I think Štěpán used the word disgrace
at the beginning,

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.300
and I thought it was a strong word,
but now I will proudly sign up for it.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.080
It is a disgrace and, in my opinion,
it is a disgrace of the Ministry of Education.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.900
That they just don't collect the data

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:40.161
I find it incredible that
we are actually in that pandemic,

00:45:40.361 --> 00:45:44.551
let's say we count from March
and now is November, 8 months

00:45:44.751 --> 00:45:49.371
and we still don't have accurate data
on those uninvolved children.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.300
We only have some estimate of the Czech School
Inspectorate, which is from the spring

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.000
and which was actually created
on the basis of some telephone inquiry

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.000
from primary school principals.
So we don't even know how accurate it is.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.200
Then there are situations that we have
a large number of non-profit organizations

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.500
that can help effectively, but they can
not just find those children in the system.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.700
So they write to us, they write to
the teachers and so. I just don't understand

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.300
why the ministry won't treat it.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.500
I've already talked
about it in several of my media appearances

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.750
in the sense that schools today report
a really huge amount of things,

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:28.200
so it would be relatively easy for them to report,
how many children are not involved.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.570
Every teacher knows how many
uninvolved children he has in that class.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.950
The fact that, we don't collect the data,
just doesn't make any sense to me

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:38.550
and I don't know why we don't do it.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:45.050
It almost seems like we want to keep
an illusion that it's better than it really is,

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.100
and we're afraid to look to truth it in the eyes,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:54.000
and say ok we just have 30,000 kids here
who are completely out of the system.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.800
Which I think is a realistic estimate.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.720
But we just need the data afterwards
and we miss it,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:06.260
so the word disgrace, as it came to me as sharp,
so now it actually comes into its place.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.250
I will return to
the question of Mrs. Helena Kotíková,

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:18.000
who asks if is at even possible to
effectively implement distance learning

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.590
for younger students, specifically
in the first and second grade.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.800
Children must learn to read and count...

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.200
Mr. Lalák, do you think it is possible
at this age to learn such basics

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.100
as reading and writing in a distance way?

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.980
When we founded
the Expedition SCIO School this year,

00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:45.500
we founded it for children from 4th to 9th grade,

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.870
We didn't include the first three years there

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:53.150
precisely because we felt a certain skepticism
about whether it was even possible

00:47:53.350 --> 00:48:01.100
to learn to read, write and basic skills
just through distance learning.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:07.500
In general I think, those children
at this age need much more support

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:12.800
from their parents. In fact, in some way,
parents have to be there with them.

00:48:13.212 --> 00:48:14.600
They have to help a lot there.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:20.700
In my opinion,
it is very challenging with these children.

00:48:20.768 --> 00:48:22.400
It is definitely appropriate to try it,

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.733
it is good for those children
from such a low age to learn it a bit,

00:48:26.933 --> 00:48:31.200
but it is definitely much more demanding than,
for children from second stage,

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.910
when I think that
some systematic involvement of distance learning

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:38.700
is simply relatively fine.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:43.000
I have the same question for Jana Urbanová,
because you are an English teacher

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.760
for the younger children, so the
same question, just about language skills,

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.170
Is it possible to distance learning language
for such small children?

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:55.000
I just had to deal with the fact that
I had a first graders this year,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.120
I'm lucky to be in a private school,
so we had good conditions.

00:48:59.132 --> 00:49:05.400
The children,
I teach, have easy access to the Internet,

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.700
and at the same time most of them had parents

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.390
who sat there all the time and helped them there.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:16.600
So it worked for us, but I'm very skeptical
about whether it would be widespread.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.700
I do not believe that in ordinary families,
where the parent has no opportunity

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:26.100
or time to be with the child and
I'm not even talking about the fact

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.320
that they often don't have digital
equipment, so no. I can't imagine it.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.560
Here the teaching is completely different,
very specific in the first grade,

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.320
really through the contact.
It must be through the video.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.950
Because they can't read
and write yet, it can't be otherwise.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.250
So I think it only works
if they have luxurious conditions.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.900
Josef Kundrát, the transition to distance learning
also applies to university teachers

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:59.000
and related to this is the knowledge
and skills to use online platforms,

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.710
which are used in distance learning.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:04.650
and one of the questions from Václav Kubljak
also points to that.

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:07.600
Did you feel sufficient support
in choosing a platform?

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.660
Did you have enough knowledge about platforms?

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.100
Did you have anyone to turn to
when you were actually thinking

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:19.400
about what online platform
to use for distance learning?

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:22.000
Did you know the advantages
and disadvantages of these platforms?

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.150
I was quite proactive in that,

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:29.500
so I actually started exploring
those options in the spring.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.250
But as for colleagues, I assume that in the spring
it was not yet completely ideal.

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:37.760
There was actually that support,

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.700
but the question is how much
educators were willing to use it.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.400
It depends on how many people
at the faculty said during the spring,

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.200
"I'll wait well and it will be gone in a month,
I will work by email

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.400
or by sharing and forwarding presentations".

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.500
Because after all, the college is really
a slightly different story

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.300
than the high school or elementary school.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:05.000
So in the spring, I think it was a lot about
a person's willingness to actually

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.050
do something extra, but there was support.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:12.400
If anyone needed something, our university
reacted very flexibly to it,

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.300
and now in the autumn, I think
that everyone has the support.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:22.250
I think that the faculty approached
it as very constructive,

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:26.000
so my story is that there was actually
no bigger problem here,

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.600
and specifically for me, with the fact that
I have a good connection at home,

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.720
we have arranged for the department,
for example, good audio technology.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.900
So I think that in some cases,
such as lectures, it is practically

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.800
a full-fledged replacement
for full-time teaching.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.800
Well, of course now, the big question is,
what about the exam period

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.500
there was a lot of discussion,
how state examinations can take place online,

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.600
whether it is possible to actually to examine

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.300
and ensure that, students have fair conditions.

00:51:56.306 --> 00:52:03.276
How to ensure, that students
will not cheat during exams.

00:52:03.193 --> 00:52:09.373
This is a big topic and different universities,

00:52:09.573 --> 00:52:11.400
as far as I know, have approached it differently.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:18.100
I think we have not implemented
online examination period yet.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.600
Everything was still offline
and it looks like, that in January

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.110
we will be able to do exams for small groups.

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:31.700
So I don't expect to be a big boom
in online exams,

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:37.700
it is a big topic now, it is necessary
and there should be more support.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:46.650
I know that we have some options,
but lot of colleagues incline to do offline exams

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:51.000
and they avoid the whole dilemma
of how to actually do it and if it's right.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.700
Thank you, four minutes left
and we have exhausted the questions

00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:58.200
so I address to you, speakers.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.000
If you still have something on your mind
or would like to respond on something

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.000
that has been said here, so you have room.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Mr. Lolák please.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:12.400
I would comment on the clash of generations
that we talked about earlier.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.600
One thing occurred to me, and that is,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:20.400
I really feel that
roles of teachers are changing a bit nowadays

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:26.000
That while there used to be such an idea
that a teacher is someone wise

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.300
who passes on knowledge to younger people.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:35.700
So nowadays the trend is heading towards
what is called guiding,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.000
and we call on the various
alternative schools in Czechia.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.210
When the teacher is not only there
to know the answers to the questions

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:47.000
and pass those answers on to the students.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.900
But it's more for taking the students
in some of their ways,

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.950
because the world is very complicated
and each student has different interests.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:00.300
So the teacher should support him
and not just tell him where to go.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:11.752
With this is connected other thing.
As we talked about the older teachers

00:54:11.952 --> 00:54:18.750
end to have a problem with digital technologies,
as Mr. Kunrát called digital clumsiness

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:28.520
So in the USA they initiatives,
that students teach their teachers digital skills,

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.800
because they just have them bigger.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.600
And I like a certain equality or reciprocity
between the teacher and the student.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.450
There is not just a teacher passing on
something, but there is a dialogue

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.850
and the people are learning from each other.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:48.850
So I think that the trend in education is,

00:54:48.858 --> 00:54:55.000
moving of the role of the teacher
from the one who dictates

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:02.230
to the role of student,
who learns together with children.

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:06.250
So I thank you for a very beneficial and
I would say a very interesting debate.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:10.800
And thank you very much, either to Mr. Lalák here

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
or to you, online for joining us and
for being part of this panel.

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:18.012
Thank you very much to the audience
