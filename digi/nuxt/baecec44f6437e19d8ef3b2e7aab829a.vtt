00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.000
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
welcome to this panel discussion 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.920
dedicated to the very interesting topic

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.240
To the topic of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.480
Digital solutions and digital threats 
in pandemic times

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.400
My name is Aneta Zachová

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.960
and I'm editor-in-chief of EURACTIV.cz

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.520
and I'm happy that I have 
the opportunity 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.880
to moderate this panel

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.040
Just to briefly introduce the topic

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.480
Modern technologies have shown us, 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.240
especially in the past months,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.320
that they can be very 
useful and helpful

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.200
in emergency situations

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.400
They were used to mitigate the impacts
 of a pandemic

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.080
Among the most popular technologies, 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.480
there were tracing apps,
for example,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.600
that were notifying their users that 
they could

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.160
for example

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.360
Be in contact with an infected person

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.040
Also,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.920
there were prominent technologies

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.200
when it comes to 
artificial intelligence

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
that were used,
for example,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280
for the predictions of the pandemic

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.320
But they were also used to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.920
let's say

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.680
improve the implementation of 
restrictive measures

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.520
Therefore we have to say that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.000
deploying modern technologies means that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.760
we are skating on thin ice

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.760
And to be honest with you, 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.200
I'm very curious about

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.520
what experts of digitalization
and connected fields

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.000
will tell us in the next 60 minutes

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.920
So, dear participants of
Going Digital conference

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
let me introduce you our great speakers

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.680
I'm very happy that here in studio

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.800
Virtual studio

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.040
is Mr. Ole Jann

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.400
Assistant professor at the Centre for 
Economical Research

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.360
and Graduate Education Economics Institute

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360
SERGE

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.520
which is a joined workplace

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.480
of Charles University and the
Czech Academy of Science

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840
Then I am also very happy 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.000
that we have online speakers here

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.280
Among them Patrick Breyer

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760
Member of the European Parliament

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.720
and the German Digital Rights Activist

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.200
Then I'm also very happy that I can
welcome here Jan Kulveit

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.240
Senior Researcher at the Future of 
Humanity Institute

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.160
at the University of Oxford

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.120
Then it's my pleasure to welcome here

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Patrick Zandl

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.440
Czech digital entrepeneur,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.160
Expert

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.600
and also member of 
the Czech Pirate Party

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.040
Before we start our discussion,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.800
I would like to ask all our participants

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.240
to interact with us through Slido

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.760
You can write there your comments
or questions

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.080
and I would be happy to address them

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.960
or not me, but my distinguished guests

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.160
But now let's start with the discussion

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040
beacuse we have only 60 minutes

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.120
We have a very interesting topic

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.880
and we have great speakers here

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.280
So let me start with the first kind of 
kickoff question

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.760
For Mr. Breyer

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.720
As I told in the beginning,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.280
We see that

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.440
tracing apps were very useful
in the times of pandemic

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.320
You could see that
many national governments

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.440
included these apps 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.200
into their national strategies in the 
fight against COVID-19 pandemic

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.960
For example, in Czech Republic we had,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.120
we still have, eRouška

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.880
In Italy, it was the application Immuni

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.360
and most of the countries in Europe

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.400
have deployed these types of application

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.160
And my question for you is

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.000
Mr Breyer, can we say that these

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.800
tracing apps are safe

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.480
when we are considering the data 
privacy and data protection

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.960
Please, Mr Breyer,
the floor is yours

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.800
Thank you Aneta and good morning 
everybody

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.760
Yes, I'm not quite convinced

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.360
that these apps are the key solution
to the pandemic

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360
and in tracking it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.240
They are generally poorly spread

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
So not very many people are using them

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.040
And so far, the contacts

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.080
Tracing the contacts of infected people

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.000
and notifying them 
has been done by humans

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.160
And a study say that

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.240
this protects us much better than an app

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.640
And would also avoid massive numbers 
of false alarms

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.000
due to those apps not being able

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.520
to detect walls,
etcetera pp

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.320
And the great risk is that

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.960
once this technology is in use

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.920
it could be made mandatory 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.600
to track people also for other purposes

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.680
What we've seen is that,
 at least in Poland,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.160
the home quarantining app

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.960
requires regular check ins

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.000
and it makes you wonder 
if it's effective

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.720
because you could still invite people
to your home, right?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720
and nobody would see

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.560
South Korea's app is actually using GPS

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.880
to track locations also in cases 
of quarantine breaches

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.680
Yes, Thailand is actually 
making travellers

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.480
use an app

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.600
to enforce their quarantine

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.320
and also to track their movements

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.920
And I think the government 
should provide

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.880
sufficient protective equipement

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880
to healthcare

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760
At testing facilities

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.280
we need to have vaccine supplies now

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.000
and prepare properly 
for future pandemics

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.640
That is, I think, what is key

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.440
and not collecting location data

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.480
Thank you very much

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.040
Just heard a bit skeptical approach

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.240
towards these tracing apps

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.440
And I'm wondering, Mr. Jann

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.480
what do you think about it?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.560
Do you agree with what 
has been said by Mr. Breyer or?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.080
What do you think about 
these tracing apps?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.080
Should we really use them massively?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.400
Should they be, for example, mandatory?

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.720
What do you think about that?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.400
I mean, I agree in broad strokes

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.240
I think they are relatively safe

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.680
At least the kind of the broad principle

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.280
of bluetooth tracing

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.960
I mean, it doesn't collect a lot of data

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.640
So the broad principle is 
relatively safe

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.560
But I agree that 
the main question is really

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.440
are they effective at all?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.960
And do they really?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.360
I mean, to my knowledge, 
there is no country

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.400
where they really yield a measurable

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.600
or large contribution to fighting 
the pandemic, right?

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.720
So even in countries where they have 
a penetration

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.360
of maybe 40% or so

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.120
Then that would mean 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.320
In theory, they could maybe

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.640
find 15%

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.840
but then people don't have 
their bluetooth switched on

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.640
and there's walls

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640
and all kinds of stuff

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.760
so maybe they could help finding

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.080
I mean, with great penetration

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.920
they could help finding 
5% of infections or so, right?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.760
So that's not a huge effect

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.120
and I think we should also
not get distracted by that

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.360
As Patrick Breyer has said,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.320
We really need investments into human
contact tracers

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.760
and we need investing into testing

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.120
and those are the political choices

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120
that have to be made

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.880
And so

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.880
Just

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.720
These apps I really

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.400
I mean

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.920
We didn't know in the beginning 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.000
It could have been that
they played a larger role

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It was a new situation

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.760
But in the end I think
they're not very effective

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.440
Should they be mandatory, I think

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.720
That would also be counterproductive

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.400
And first of all,
I don't think they would

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.560
increase the effectiveness very much

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.600
But it would, of course,
lead to a huge backlash

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.440
that suddenly the government 
wants you to have

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.400
apps on your phone
that track and trace you

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.080
And it would,
I mean,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.320
Even though the apps themselves 
are relatively safe in data terms

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.640
You would then have to build
a surveillance infrastructure

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.440
to check whether people
actually use the apps

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.160
So that would defeat the purpose of

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.040
having good privacy apps

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.040
So that I think 
would be very inadvisable

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.400
making any of this mandatory

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.840
Thank you very much Mr. Jann

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.120
I have now a question for Mr. Zandl

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.960
who is connected to us virtually

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.280
We were talking about the effectiveness 

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.520
of the tracing application

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.000
What do you think?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.200
How to make these applications

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.400
As much as possible

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.360
But while protecting the privacy

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.880
and the data of the users?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.240
Please Mr Zandl

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520
Hello everybody

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.400
Going back in the time, 

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.240
in the spring
we were worried about what the

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.560
paid solution would like

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.600
would like to see

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.480
That is why we started to prepare
our own eRouška application

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.120
in the volunteer activity COVID19 CZ

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.280
And this application
was based on strict principles

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.080
for personal data protection

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.600
Above all, 

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.200
it was not intended 
to work with the location 

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.720
or with the usernames

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.800
And it was just based
on the voluntarity 

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.440
And this application succeed

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.080
using Bluetooth,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.360
not using GPS,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.400
protecting your personal data

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.320
That was our choice

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.640
And i need to say
there was a possibility

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.960
that the Czech Republic
would use Israelian application 

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.000
which is quite invasive

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.400
in the user data

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.520
Surveilling the user
without his permission

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.600
And that was the possibility
we would like not to accept

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.440
Thank you very much

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.280
I have a follow up question
for Mr. Kulveit

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.600
Literally, the same question

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.920
as I already gave to our other speakers

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.880
What do you think about the 
effectiveness of these tracing apps?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.160
Do you think that
they can really help us

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.520
to tackle the pandemic?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.440
Or what are the barriers
of their effective use?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.800
Please Mr. Kulveit

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200
Good morning

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200
So

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.560
As all have said,
they are not very effective

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.400
It was not clear, like,
from the beginning

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.400
But I think now 
they are in some sense

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.400
like part of the solution

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.040
but only a relatively small part

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.800
It’s not the core of the strategy

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400
Maybe

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.000
Connecting a bit
to the previous speakers,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.680
I think in all anticovid measures
typically the question,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.760
the right question isn't

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.120
whether like this measure is
better than some other measure

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120
Whether, I don’t know,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.800
better personal protective equipment

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.360
is better than the tracing apps

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.040
But in a sense like every person counts,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.280
every person that people traced or

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.640
the spread of the disease prevented counts

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.360
So tracing the correct measure is

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.920
basically look at something like

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.640
cost versus benefits of the measures

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.160
So if it’s a measure
reduces the reproduction

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.040
but it’s just like 3 persons

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.120
it can mean that like, I don’t know,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.720
one more year of school could be open and so on 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.960
I think they are not
the core of contact tracing

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.360
in any Western country

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
At the same time,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.440
they still seem to be
pretty cost efficient

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.040
if they're like connected
to some broader

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.960
test and trace strategy


00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.080
Thank you very much Mr. Kulveit 

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.840
I have again question for Mr. Breyer 

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.880
Because you have kind of
a European perspective,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.680
let's say

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.520
When there was this problem of the COVID

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.440
and the national borders were closed

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.160
Many people thought that

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.240
with these applications
it would be much more easier,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.000
for example,
to travel also in the times of pandemic

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.720
That the national tracing apps
will be somehow connected

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.720
so we could share the data

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.440
But if i'm not mistaken,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.600
I don't think that this is
something that really happened 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.000
that we have this kind of
connected tracing apps in Europe

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.320
I see that Mr. Kulveit
maybe wants to add something

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
if I'm not mistaken

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
Please Mr. Kulveit

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.920
Yeah, actually the apps

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.480
which are using
the Google and Apple protocol

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.800
are like interoperable

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.800
So it’s not actually true
they are not connected

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.400
They're running on the same protocol

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.560
As in the governments
running the applications are

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.440
right now working on
making them like interoperable

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.240
in the sense that, if you have
a positive result from Germany

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.880
it will be messaged if you
met people from other countries

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:55.280
This is not a case that 
they wouldn’t be interoperable at all

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.400
Thank you very much

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.040
Let’s go back to Mr. Breyer

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.560
What do you think about this connectivity of

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.600
the European tracing application?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.920
Is it truly working?

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.480
We just heard that the applications
are interoperable

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.200
but are they really working currently?


00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200
Please Mr. Breyer

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.680
Well from the German experience

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.440
I know that they had a lot of problems

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.360
that these apps
weren’t working for weeks

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.800
and they only found out later 

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.720
and then some users,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.760
depending on the system configuration,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.360
didn't actually receive
warnings and alerts

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.960
so there were technical problems

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.600
But what you mentioned
was the risk indeed

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.280
that they would use the opening up

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.840
to make this
and allowing travels dependening

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.440
on agreeing to using the app 

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.520
and that would really be
an indirect obligation to use it

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.520
and that was a great risk 

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.000
but it’s true that
it hasn’t happened in Europe so far 

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.720
And people can have good reasons
not to use these apps,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720
not only because they don't trust them

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.680
but also maybe they don’t want
to carry a mobile phone

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.880
If you carry a mobile phone

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.760
then the operator
will be tracking you anyway

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.080
and collecting the data
about your location in the database

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.080
which can be used to incriminate you

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.200
if you have been to a protest 

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.560
where, you know, 
criminal offences occurred

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.920
Or even if you’ve been
in the wrong place at the wrong time

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.760
you could be targeted by the police

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.200
or some crime happened nearby

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200
etcetera pp

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.960
And people can have good reasons
for not using them

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.880
Also in my case, for example,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.760
I don't use
either Android nor Apple iPhone

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.840
but I actually use
a free open source operating system 

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.600
where I could theoretically
examine the code

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.840
and make sure it is safe

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.960
and these apps don’t even work

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.600
on open source mobile operating systems

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.000
Meaning that they are 
actually using operating systems

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.600
that are closed source partly

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.960
you don’t know what’s happening

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.480
and you also don’t know what's 
happening at the receiving end

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.520
So whether the server is 
actually logging requests

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.680
for example,
it’s logging your IP address

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.280
You can’t be sure

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.040
So

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.680
The roles of these apps is really
a large scale social experiment

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.720
that involves digital
behaviour recording

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.600
under state supervision

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.360
for the first time really

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.880
And that is the risk in it

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.360
and that’s why I think
that the benefit

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.800
needs to be balanced
against the risks

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.360
And even if it could, you know,
trace some percentages of infections

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.080
if there are alternatives
that don’t come with those risks 

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.040
we should definitely look into
those and prefer those

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.560
And I have maybe
a follow up question for you

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.080
Do we have these types of alternatives
without risks?


00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.840
Can you name them if we have some things

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.440
we can use for this tracing
but without these risks?

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.400
Yes, what works very well is
human tracing 

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.200
so you basically ask people 
where they have been

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.840
and whom they have been in touch with

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.920
and usually it works much better,
as it has been said,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.920
because many people just won't be using 
and carrying the app anyway

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.760
The manual tracing is more effective

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.720
If you reach out to people actually

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.160
Of course you may not trace all contacts

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.600
but the app will trace even less

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.600
Thank you very much 

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.760
I just now want to ask our participants
to give us questions comments

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.480
You can write in the chat

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.960
and I would be happy to address it here

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.680
I have now a question for Mr. Jann

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.000
We are still discussing
about the tracing apps

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.840
and I would like to stick
to this topic a bit longer 

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.080
I'm interested in like

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.800
are the people really willing
to install these applications?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.360
or do you think
they are considering these risks

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.440
 that for example,
Mr. Breyer has just told us?

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.720
Are they aware of this? 

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.160
And do you think it can,
for example, distract them

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.480
from the installation of
these tracing apps?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.280
Please

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.320
So first of all, a quick comment
to Patrick Breyer

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.720
I mean, the human contact tracing
is not without risks either

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.840
because also you collect
a lot of personal data in that

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.840
and I think there has also been
a bit of cavalier attitude 

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840
at least in some countries

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.840
about how to deal with this data

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.760
You know, if my contact tracer

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.000
well I never had that call fortunately,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.440
but if a contact tracer calls me
and says where have you been?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.680
And I say ‘Oh you know, 
then I went out with my wife, 

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.160
and then I went out with my girlfriend

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.640
and then I visited my second family

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.600
and all these things, right?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.920
So how is this data being taken care of?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.160
and how do these incentives interact
with people incentives

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.320
to actually cooperate with this kind
of contact tracing

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.560
So now are people aware of
the risks of the apps?

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.160
I think we see the same there 
as we see in general discussions

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.360
of privacy in the population

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.920
That some people are overly sensitive

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.280
Some people say I will never allow
anything on my phone

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.720
And some people are kind of under sensitive 
and say, you know,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.480
I have nothing to hide
so i have nothing to fear 


00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.720
All of these quite simple but 
too simple arguments that we know

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.840
So my feeling was that
the discussion of tracing apps is

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.880
really very quickly fell into these old

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.680
front warfare between these groups

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.160
And I think not that much

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.880
or I mean, not as much progress
as we could have hoped

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.520
was made beyond that 

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.560
So that the very basic point that 
bluetooth tracing apps

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.320
doesn't need location data

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.120
as Patrick Zandl pointed out,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.160
basically doesn't need any kind of data

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.640
that we would consider
sensitive personal data

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.080
That very basic point I think
was often lost in the discussion

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.760
between nothing to hide,
nothing to fear

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.800
and you know, tomorrow in 1984

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.320
the government will take all our data 
and put us into slavery

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.720
So those extreme discussions
kind of drowned out

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.360
a lot of the reasonable debate
I felt on this topic


00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.240
Thank you very much


00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.160
I have a follow up question
for Mr. Zandl


00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.800
Because Mr. Zandl is pretty much aware 
of the situation in the Czech Republic

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.520
Of our eRouška application

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.520
We just heard that eRouška is
using the Bluetooth technology

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.080
it's not like ran on the data

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.520
So it doesn’t need to 
get our data from people

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.840
But still

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.680
for example me 
as one of the users of the eRouška

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.960
I know that everytime I switch it on 

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.920
It takes battery and so on

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.600
And so i'm interested in like 
how the people in the Czech Republic

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.240
really reacted to this possibility
to have this kind of application 

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.880
I don't’ know if you could, for example, 

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.520
tell us how efficient was eRouška
in the Czech Republic

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.360
Given the fact that, let’s say,
that this type of application

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.560
is not connected with
as many risky situations

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.640
For example as was mentioned in Poland

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.800
when the users have to
check in regularly

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.240
So please could you tell us something 
more about this Czech eRouška?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.720
Please Mr. Zandl

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
Hopefully

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720
Hopefully I can

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.280
I need to say we have tried all three 
approaches

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.480
to this application

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.040
Even GPS based location

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.840
it was included in Mapy.cz 

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.320
Which is the largest
Czech geographic portal

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.800
Over 1 million users follow
this mobile application

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.560
And inside this application was
GPS tracking for the location

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.320
and if you met somebody
who was COVID positive 

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.960
you received some notice

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.880
But this was devastating your battery 

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.680
and of course it was
devastating your privacy

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.320
even when we promised you 

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.040
or Seznam, 
the owner of the application,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.960
promised you not to give
the data outside the company

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.280
This is one approach

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.800
The second approach is eRouška
going through the Bluetooth

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.320
Total privacy 

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.760
And not so much devastating the battery

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.880
And the third approach is localization
through the mobile network 

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.440
Because each mobile network knows
where is your mobile phone 

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.800
the accuracy is not so nice

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:19.360
but several tenths or
hundred meters is enough 

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.680
And this is even a big invasion
in your privacy 

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.240
And even we don’t like this approach

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.880
About some statistics
or what was the experience

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.160
We have almost no complaints
about eRouška

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.000
Of course many journalists ask
‘How does it work?’

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.760
We explain a lot how does it work 

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.680
Everybody have on the beginning fear
how the application will track him 

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.400
But it was an open source application 

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.360
Everybody can look in the source codes

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.280
and go through the code

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.200
And evaluate the privacy impact

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.160
And what was the question?

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.680
Yes 

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.280
Thank you very much Mr. Zandl

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.920
We were talking about the
Czech application eRouška

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:27.480
and I have here a question
from one of our participants 

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.920
Oh yeah I see

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.680
Yes


00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.240
Maybe it’s a question for you
Mr. Zandl or for Mr. Kulveit

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.320
The question is

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.480
In your opinion,

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.640
which COVID tracing apps 
were successful in insight

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.800
and were they worth their price?

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.280
I don’t know, maybe Mr. Zandl you would
like to address this comment


00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.440
Yeah

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.680
Quite important is not the type
of collecting the data for the users

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.360
But integration to the state processes

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.960
What does it mean?

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.200
If you are COVID positive in 
some applications in some states 

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.160
You get in the application 
a confirmation for your employer

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.120
that you are sick
and you could stay home

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.600
And you can send it directly
through the application

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:26.040
The same way you will
become invitation for the test

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.480
Or the letter from your doctor

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.880
It means the communication is totally
digital and totally integrated

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.040
In the Czech Republic
this system doesn’t work

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.720
You just become the notice if you are 
positive or negative after the test


00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.400
But integration is not tied

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.400
and during the wrong situation 

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.800
But it has nothing to do
with the application

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:59.280
but with the lack of digitalisation
of Czech state processes 


00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.480
Thank you very much

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:09.400
We just gave quite like a critical
insight about the connection

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.440
between the application and the,
for example, tracing teams

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.960
or something like that 

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:22.600
Maybe Mr. Kulveit, I don't know,
you have maybe a European perspective

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.880
So maybe you know how does it,
for example,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.360
work in other European countries

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.000
Mr. Kulveit,
could you tell us if

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.760
in Europe, for example,
or around the whole world

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:39.480
Do we have some kind of
really successful tracing app

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:46.400
That is for example also addressing
these problems mentioned by Mr. Zandl?


00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040
Yes so

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.880
I mean, I think like 

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.400
Okay

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.120
I think the contact tracing application

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.560
I’m not an expert on contact tracing 
applications in Europe maybe

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.480
But I guess like more knowledge
of the landscape

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.120
So I know for example the UK
contact tracing app

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.160
is also used for tracing people
visiting restaurants and so on

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.600
So it's not just like Bluetooth
but you scan QR codes

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.840
and if you get the notification like
you are invited to get tested and so on


00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.680
So I think it could be a valuable part
of some like overall strategy

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.680
Its difficult to

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:44.440
So far it's a bit difficult to evaluate
what's really successful 

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:52.280
Like worldwide I would say in some sense
in like dealing with pandemic

00:27:52.280 --> 00:28:00.800
Probably like the applications in 
places like China are pretty effective

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.280
at tracing the contacts
and finding people who are infected

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.880
So from my perspective the question

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.440
the question which Europe or 
people in Europe should ask

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.960
is basically how to have 
effective solutions

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.480
at the same level 
of efficiency as in China

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.760
and have privacy at the same time

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.440
So instead of this like push and pull 
which like all have mentioned,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.040
finding about whether
any data would be used 

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.960
or any technology would be used

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.480
or it would be old plain humans
calling over the phone

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.400
which also doesn’t work so great

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.320
So instead of despite

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.720
I think the big question
for the future is 

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.240
how to have the best of both worlds

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.520
And I don't think this is a purely 
hypothetical question

00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.000
where like can say ‘Okay we hate the 
Chinese approach to privacy

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.360
and we will fight 
to our last breaths to avoid it’

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.040
I mean in some broader context 
a lot of developed countries

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.400
are looking for where to develop
or what to do

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:23.720
Western countries have like a lot of 
power in being role models and so on

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.120
in handling things in a good way 

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.440
So basically my worry
about bureau landscape is like

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.680
If EU decides
'Okay we will basically resign

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.840
at choosing data in a reasonable way'

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.360
we‘ll try to protect privacy
at all costs

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.920
Even at the cost of
like worse governments

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.840
and worse ability to deal
with stuff like pandemics

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.280
Like a big part of the world

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.360
Considering a few billion people

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.640
will look at China and they will see

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.480
'Okay but the Chinese way
maybe works better’ 

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.440
People are not dying in China 

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.640
The economy is growing 

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840
So maybe

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.040
Asian or East Asian or Chinese 
or Taiwanese approach to privacy

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.560
is maybe all things considered better 

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:22.000
and maybe it's better to sacrifice
 privacy in sake of economic growth

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.160
and saving lives and so on

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.040
So I think we are risking in like 
dealing the situation badly

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.560
it's basically probably privacy
of like a few billion people

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.680
Not necessarily people in Europe 

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.160
So I would like to fight 
for solutions which are

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.000
at the same time privacy protecting

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.520
and at the same time are efficient 


00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.960
So I think European applications are 
typically too much on the side of 

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.680
protecting privacy at like
at the cost of not being efficient 

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.440
Applications elsewhere
are more efficient

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.440
and in big part 
it's a technological problem

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.960
how to design something which works well
and protects the privacy

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.480
Which is typically more difficult 

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.400
It needs cryptography and so on

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.960
But I think this is a bigger question 
for the future

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.960
Not for COVID

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.760
With COVID like vaccination will
probably start pretty soon

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.760
Sorry for the longer time

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.400
No, it's absolutely okay 

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.400
Thank you very much Mr. Kulveit

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.080
Mr. Jann we just heard
from Mr. Kulveit that 

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.160
in the future we have to
find this balance

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.080
between the effective fight 
against COVID and the data protection 

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:46.720
And that we can for example also learn 
some experience from Asian countries

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.120
that are not so fixed on this
data protection as we Europeans

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.760
Do you think that we have 
already some lessons learned

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:07.480
from this tracing versus data protection

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:15.040
for future emergency situations such as 
pandemic or something like that?

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.400
Do we already know what we should,
 for example,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.440
do in the next emergency situation?

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.080
So I think I agree with
Honza Kulveit there

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.640
I mean for COVID 
it's kind of too late already, right?

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.200
So

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.720
Because the, I mean,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.120
One the one hand the basic principle is

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.120
we really don't need sensitive data 
to trace

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.400
I mean, in theory we don't need sensitive data
to trace infections

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.440
We really just need proximity data

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.240
and then I mean one number 
that you can call

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.400
and say ‘hey you've been in touch
with someone’

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.760
But

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.800
The technological and also the kind of 
the conceptual hurdles to that

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.160
are immense, right?

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.720
Because then we still

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.680
I mean, how do we collect 
the data in such a way

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.960
that we have exactly the data 
that we need

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.800
And not collect a lot of personal data 
on the way, right?

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.040
And this is where,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.200
as Honza has said,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.280
Different countries are taking different 
approaches and are on different sides

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.480
And I think there is this middle
weight that was mentioned

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.640
But we need 

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.280
My guess is that we need
several more decades of 

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.560
having a better understanding of
 what data actually is 

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.880
What privacy actually is

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.000
How differential privacy can work

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.520
How cryptography can work to protect 

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.000
To on the one hand protect private data

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.600
but also make it useable
for some purposes and so on

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.800
And there I think we're just

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.440
I mean we will need

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.640
we have the hardware technology
to some extent

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.920
But we need several more decades
of conceptual research

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.360
to be able to really understand these
questions and solve these questions

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.120
So I think even if 
it's quicker than that

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.760
I think that for COVID
we will be too late

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.600
Yeah

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.920
Thank you very much

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.000
I have a similar question for Mr. Breyer

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.600
Do you think that we have found
this kind of balance

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.840
between the privacy protections 
and between the effective fight

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.400
against COVID and these kinds of things?

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.600
Are we now more ready 
for future challenges

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.520
based on our past experience
from COVID19 crisis?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.800
Please Mr. Breyer

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760
I have my doubts

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.600
whether there are sufficient plans

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.280
and contingency measures
for the next pandemic

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.080
Which is pretty much certain
to come in the future

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.040
I don’t think 
all lessons have been learnt 

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.200
What we’ve seen in Europe is a very
desperate approach to the crisis

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:57.600
So every national government
went ahead and, you know,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.920
just implemented their own measures
without coordination

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.560
They closed down the borders

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.080
thinking that the risk was people
from other European countries

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.080
Which wasn’t at all

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.040
Not an effective measure at all

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.040
And let me also stress

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.520
In comparison to Asia the key to 
containing the pandemic

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.760
is not surveillance

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.160
that maybe is used over there

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.880
But the key is really
precautionary measures

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:28.920
and making sure that the number
of contacts is decreased in time


00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.240
Before the numbers start exploding

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.720
And those are political choices

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.880
and we’ve seen some countries in Europe 
that have dealt very well

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.480
In line with strong privacy policies,

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.240
and we’ve seen others that 
didn’t do well with the pandemic at all

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.080
But it didn't have anything to do
with the technology or surveillance 

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.120
I think that when it comes to the apps
everybody should have the free choice

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.600
whether to use them or not 

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.720
and I would also like to acknowledge
that those Bluetooth based systems

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.160
you know on the open designs like EPEP
or DP Consortium self designed

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.480
They are designed
in a privacy friendly way

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.240
and therefore I would like to
thank everybody

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.640
who was involved in their development 
and preventing worse

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.880
But still

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.800
even these apps with the privacy 
friendly design come with 12 risks

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.760
of abuse 

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.840
As it has been counted 
for data protection impact assessment

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.600
Even the Bluetooth tracing

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:33.200
Even though these risks may sound 
alarmist or paranoid or over sensitive

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.960
we’ve really seen too often governments
seize something that

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.320
has been introduced once for a specific
purpose


00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.160
 in a data protection friendly way

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320
to seize this

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.760
To make it permanent to use it
for other purposes

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.360
And abuse it

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.160
And there has been nobody
less than Edward Snowden 

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.720
who has been warning that
this pandemic is being used

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.440
to deploy technology that 
will become permanent 

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.520
and that will be expanded later on

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.960
We are already seeing outside Europe

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.280
that they’ve used it
to introduce facial recognition

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.360
To bring drones policing people 

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.640
And since somebody mentioned China

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.520
China is really rapidly turning into 
a digital dictatorship

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.480
It may be that people
aren't dying there but

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.600
They have been arrested for

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.440
I don't know, for their religion,
for their thoughts

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.560
And sometime they're even being tortured

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.440
They are being detained in camps

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.200
And in no way and respect 
should we ever think

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.840
you know, what China is doing
is worth looking into


00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.640
That is a oppressive dictatorship

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.600
And should not be used
as a reference in Europe at all

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.240
Thank you very much

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.680
I would like to now maybe move
 a bit to the topic

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.040
you have already mentioned Mr. Breyer

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.280
It means, for example,
facial recognition softwares

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.600
and other new technologies

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.240
that are based, for example,
on artificial intelligence

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.800
Because we do not have
only these tracing apps

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.480
as a kind of new way how fight pandemics

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.440
But we have also artificial intelligence

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:19.840
Mr. Kulveit can you tell us how 
the artificial intelligence helped us

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.960
 to tackle the pandemic?

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.080
Do we have any tangible results?

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.000
Please Mr. Kulveit

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.160
Yeah so I think artificial intelligence
is now used as a buzzword

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.560
for like all kinds of stuff

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.200
So I would say like 
proper artificial intelligence

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.120
didn't the help us basically at all

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.560
I think it's quite unrelated

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.000
Like plain old mathematical modeling

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.960
which is pretty boring term for 
using some equations and number

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.280
was pretty useful

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.560
And some machine learning
techniques say like

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.160
It's like

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:12.480
Normal statistical methods are pretty 
useful for evaluating all kinds of stuff

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.400
making predictions and so on

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:20.240
I would not consider it
as artificial intelligence topic

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.720
But I can answer some things
about statistical modeling

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.360
Sorry for that 

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.440
I still feel some urge to reply
a little bit to Patrick Breyer

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.880
So I think there is a dangerous policy to

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.680
to say that China is doing
some horrible things,

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.760
like torturing people,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.760
And for that reason any reference
to China is like invalid

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.520
and shouldn’t be done at all

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360
I mean

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.960
China is like a pretty complex place

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.320
And if we just closed our eyes and say
there's nothing to learn from China

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.880
Then all the knowledge of how to do 
things in governments

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.640
and like everything about

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.320
We have all the knowledge in the West

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.880
And there is absolutely nothing
to learn from China 

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.920
I think this is like a pretty
dangerous approach

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:27.400
Which will ultimately not help us 
and not help our values

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.200
So I just want to strongly object
to that approach 

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.360
So

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.800
Back to AI

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.160
I think AI is like super important

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.360
and a really big topic

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.440
But it was not like directly relevant
in COVID

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.560
Mainly

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.760
Many places in governments 
and as a whole

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.680
failed to use reasonably
much simpler technology


00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.280
For predicting COVID you don't need

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.560
you typically don't need AI

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.960
You need pretty old boring 
epidemiological modeling

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.000
Thank you

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.360
I don’t know Mr. Breyer 
if you would like to react

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.600
on what has been said
when it comes to China

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.160
and if we can learn something from China

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.200
Mr Breyer, would you like to react?

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.120
Yeah sure

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.360
It’s an interesting debate

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.160
and I know that
even the Czeh Republic and Prague 

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.600
 have been very critical of China

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.240
and actually quite courageous
in standing up against their policies

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.640
Of course I'm not opposed to speaking
and engaging in a scientific dialogue 

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.200
But too often
it's been forgotten the context

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.600
in which this kind of research
is being done

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.760
Or in which these policies
are being applied in China

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.800
That a lot of them is only possible

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.920
because they have this oppressive regime

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.920
where people are not given a choice 

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.640
Where there is no open debate

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.240
Where there is no open dissent
that is possible

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.160
And even in the field of science,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.240
that really relies on critical debate,

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:21.720
which is only within very tight limits
possible in China

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.800
And so there is a danger that China
does stuff that

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.840
fundamentally violates human rights

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.800
And that we forget this context 

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.560
And then actually find it quite
useful or attractive

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:41.520
and just forget the context 
which has made it possible

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.640
to develop and implement this at all

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.040
But I would also like to agree
with Jan Kulveit regarding this

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.800
buzzword of artificial intelligence

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.320
That is often really not intelligence 
but rather dumb statistics

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.720
And the most prominent example of all
these called AI

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:06.280
but often it doesn't really involve 
a lot of intelligence

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.920
is biometrics mass surveillance

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.760
And in the context of the pandemic,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.760
for example in Moscow,

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.400
this has been used to enforce 
the quarantine

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.400
So they have this

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.360
biometrics surveillance system 
connected to CCTV cameras

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.360
all over Moscow

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.280
And they are actually using it

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.400
to find people
who violate their quarantine 

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.960
and would send the police
to find or arrest you

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.360
if you violated that 

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.000
And the risk that comes with this is

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.760
that

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.600
first of all, the technology is 
becoming mandatory

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.360
because it works less well 
on certain groups of people

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.160
like people of colour or elderly

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:54.080
But also it is, of course, used to
target specific groups particularly

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.520
Including dissenters and protesters

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.800
And it creates a chilling effect

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.040
where people sort of feel whenever
they move somewhere

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.880
somebody might be following 
and tracing them

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.120
And you don't actually know
if you are in the database

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.880
If somebody is interested
in your movements 

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.680
So it’s a system of offline tracking

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.040
and you’d be cautious

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:24.320
mass surveillance 
that we need to stop from

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.400
Prevent from happening in Europe

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.160
And that's why we started an initiative
in the European Parliament

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:36.120
For a ban of these biometrics mass 
surveillance technologies in the EU

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.520
Thank you very much

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.840
I have a question for Mr. Jann

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.360
We are now talking about these softwares

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.320
for example for facial recognition 

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.800
Do you think that it is acceptable
for the society

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.040
for the people

00:44:53.400 --> 00:45:01.680
to deploy these kinds of technologies
in order to improve the surveillance?

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.600
Are people ready to be, let's say, 

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.520
be overviewed by the artificial intelligence?

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.560
No, this is of course

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.840
This is a highly dangerous question

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.840
And there are, I mean

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.840
I must say I don't really see
the danger so much in the EU

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.800
but maybe there Patrick Breyer
is closer to the source than I am 

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.040
But, I mean, in oppressive regimes
of course


00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.560
They are using COVID now
as a justification for

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.000
 ruling out all kinds of 
additional surveillance

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.480
I think 

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.600
Again we have to ask,
are these really effective, right?

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.040
And I think I agree with 
the previous speakers there

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.680
 that I don't really know of
any use case where AI

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.680
has really made a big difference to
fighting the pandemic, right?

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.680
So I mean of course

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.680
Additional surveillance that might
involve AI maybe yes

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.720
But in a acceptable way not 

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.760
And I think also there again 

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.960
we should not get distracted by that one

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.720
so maybe we should use everything that
has more benefits than cost 

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.880
But we should not get distracted 
by these discussions

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.280
because what really fight the pandemic

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.200
and what for example prevents the virus 
from spreading

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.480
is a simple mask, right?

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.800
So that is really low tech

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.800
There is no AI

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.760
There is not even regressions or 
machine learning in masks, right?

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760
Just put on a mask

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.640
Just not got to events


00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.640
Just not meet people at home
and in badly ventilated places

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.520
And those are the very basic things

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.280
So what we really need is
basic human intelligence

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.640
Not advance artificial intelligence
for these problems, right?

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.800
And we should really not get distracted
with these discussions

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080
Thank you very much

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.240
That's a very good point

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.800
I think that we need human intelligence 
especially

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.080
more than artificial intelligence,
let’s say 

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.160
I have now a question for Mr. Zandl

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.760
Who is again very aware of the situation
in the Czech Republic

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.120
We were talking about
the artificial intelligence 

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.760
and about difference 
between artificial intelligence

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.760
and just the role of
statistics and modeling

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.400
Do you think that right now our Czech
government

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.880
or other governments in Europe

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:27.440
are efficiently using these data or 
technologies that are here right now?

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.440
Or

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.240
Do you think that, for example,
we have technologies

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.440
We have data but the governments 
are not using them effectively?

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.080
Please Mr. Zandl

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.680
I think it's quite a broad topic 

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.440
What does it mean when we say 
you died with COVID?

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.960
Does it mean that you have been tested 
after the death

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.800
and you are positive?

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.000
Or does it mean that we are not testing
you after death 

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.800
and we just keep your previous test?

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.720
It means we have a lot of data

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.400
 but the data are not taken
the same way 

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.920
Country by the country

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920
It varies

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.240
This is the first problem

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.000
The second problem in Czech Republic

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.440
we have really low level of 
digitalisation of state processes 

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.800
It means we even have no sufficient data

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.360
and we are not ready to work with them

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.240
We are not ready to analyse them
on the government level

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.400
And that's a huge problem

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.320
and you may 
with the second wave of pandemic

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.920
we were totally unprepared

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.280
Like in the first wave, of course, there was

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760
not a difference

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.600
That's our main problem

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.080
we are not ready to use data

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:09.440
and the government has not mentally
shifted from the old fashion way 

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.080
working with papers and pens

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.480
to the new way working with data

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.560
Sorry for that

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520
Thank you very much

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.680
I would like to ask again
our participants

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.320
to give us their comments or questions
to the chat

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.960
And I have now also question 
for Mr. Kulveit 

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.120
which is related to 
what has been said already  

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:42.040
How to like kind of push the national 
government to really use the data 

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.800
and the modeling
that are really on the table?

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.720
Because you already mentioned,
Mr. Kulveit, that

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.320
when we are talking about artificial intelligence
it's not about the real intelligence

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.360
but it's mostly discussion about the
statistics and modelling let’s say 

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.760
What do you think about that?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:06.400
Do you think that governments are using
these data that are provided by you,

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.400
by the experts,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:12.880
efficiently or how should we like
push them to really do it?

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.920
Please Mr. Kulveit

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.080
So I mean

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.320
In practice I would say there are really
big differences between countries

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.840
Like

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.320
In February

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.200
I really was like

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.040
As a field epidemic modelling 

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.840
Will maybe

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:44.240
will be used in just some of the bigger
countries like US or UK 

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.880
So we’ve started a project
called epidemic forecasting

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.920
 where we ended up advising
multiple places

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:55.240
which were like a bit underpowered
in terms of epidemic modelling

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.040
I would say there are like big 
differences between countries

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:04.360
so probably the best thing is 
just to look around 

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:10.360
How these sources reflects 
scientific information

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.440
are integrated in decision making
in different places

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.120
And like look what

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:22.040
basically what organizational structure
allows efficient flow of information

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.520
So

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.480
I mean I would just like try to learn
from some of the better cases in Europe

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.760
Also while in the US

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.880
While, for example, in the US

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.280
many things failed
in the political level

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.640
I think on the way 
how to integrate some

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.920
basic forecasting and epidemic modelling

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.800
like US CDC is doing is doing a job

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:52.440
like it's playing
like a set of multimodel

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.080
Like basically different academic places
are like currently on models

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.400
CDC collects the data and

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.240
displays some like aggregate forecast

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.240
So

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.000
kind of everyone can see some 
short time forecast and so on

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.680
Yeah, that's probably the basic concept 

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.120
Sorry a bit to the previous question 

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.720
How AI could be used

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.400
In a broader context

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.400
I think actually AI could be super
useful in the future

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.280
 in like preventing, for example,
 the next pandemic

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.600
where we can imagine some
 like biosurveying system

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.960
 like for example
collecting sample of the air

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.240
in all big airports

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:47.360
and analysing
if some new infectious agent

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.800
is in the air 

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:55.720
So this would be like
really machine learning

00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:00.720
Heavy project processing
like extreme amounts of data

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.920
So I think is like

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.280
in terms of where AI really 
could be important 

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.360
So like preventing worse

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.000
next and worse pandemic

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.200
Like it could be important

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.680
that this is unfortunately a topic 
which draws

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.880
a really small fraction of
attention paid to COVID

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.160
or like face recognition and so on

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.560
Maybe my epilogue will be not focus
so much on the

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:37.840
shiny topics like facial recognition

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.520
Where there's a lot of controversy
about it and so on

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.080
But maybe there's so much potential to
use AI for the really important things

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.760
So sorry for late reply
to the last question

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.360
Thank you very much Mr. Kulveit

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.960
I have a question related to the future

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:05.480
because now we are facing the pandemic
and it seems

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:12.040
that we will have to deal with it
another few more weeks

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.000
 or maybe also months

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:14.880
A year

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.880
A year at least

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.880
A year

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.880
Thank you

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.880
A year

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.960
And now we also deployed
many modern technologies

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.600
 like tracing apps,
like the artificial intelligence 

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.680
or the data and statistics
and the modeling 

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.760
So I’m interested

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.760
what do you think will happen after
this COVID19

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.840
or COVID20 pandemic will end?

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:54.520
Do you think that these technologies 
will be still on the table?

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:59.440
That they will become permanent,
 let’s say

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.960
permanent issues 

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.040
permanent parts of our daily lives?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.960
And what do you think Mr. Jann?

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:16.480
 is it just like a temporary digital 
world we are living now?

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.560
or is it for next decades?


00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.720
Well, I mean 

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.680
 the oppressive regimes that are 
rolling out video surveillance

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.240
and face recognition and so on

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.080
that of course will probably 
not disappear

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.240
So that's the biggest problem

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.240
I think here

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:37.160
I mean these bluetooth tracing apps
they have no use at all, right?

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:42.360
I mean once we have a vaccination rate
of maybe 50% - 60%

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.800
which again will take maybe a year, 
maybe more

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.760
Maybe will never be reached
if we lose the kind of

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.040
 fight about whether vaccines
are good or not

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.600
Then these Bluetooth apps
have no more use

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.960
so I think they will disappear

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.360
I think I mean we will go back from
Zoom meetings to real meetings

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.200
Some meetings will stay Zoom meetings

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.720
Some meetings that should have been
Zoom meetings before the pandemic 

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.160
 will stay to be Zoom meetings 

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.120
I think I want to say 
one more thing about data

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.080
Because we were talking here about data

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.040
and do government use the data correctly

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.000
and is there enough data and so on

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.480
And I think what we really need 
to be clear here

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.200
that there is not a supply problem

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.040
Okay, so we don't have a problem
that there is too little data

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.520
We really have a demand problem

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.040
So because politicians

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.720
they have the data that they would need 
to make the most basic decisions 

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.560
They could ask for more data

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.440
So we have these institutes that are
able to produce more data

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.520
But if you look at the Czech Republic

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.880
the first lockdown we got 

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.080
Because some guy

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.160
With all due respect 

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.600
Some guy made an Excel sheet

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.720
and talked his way into
the prime minister office, right?

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.000
In the second wave,
 the lockdown happened far too late

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.880
even though in August everyone
who read the data carefully

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.040
could see that we were headed
for a catastrophe right?

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.280
And still in late August the most 
basic measures were vetoed

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.920
at the highest level of government,
right?

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.240
So and then of course,

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.560
I mean, if we had better data
about mobility

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.480
or more high frequency data or so

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.840
that might now

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.040
nerds like myself or Jan Kulveit,

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.520
sorry Honza,

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.440
 that might allow us to be slightly
faster in predicting

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.920
or might make slightly more
accurate predictions, right?

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.360
But if at the highest level of 
government there’s, I mean, basic

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.760
What you could call almost
statistical illiteracy, right?

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.400
That kind of ignores
these steady growths

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.920
This steady exponential growth

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.120
of case numbers that we saw from

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.480
I mean, that we could kind of see 
already in July

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.280
but that we really saw in August

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.080
And doesn't make decisions
based on that

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.400
Then we really have to say
it is a demand problem

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640
Not a supply problem

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.640
 because all the data you needed
to predict that

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.440
was freely available at dozen of places
on the internet

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.160
Thank you very much

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.520
I’m interested if this kind of
demand problem

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.160
mentioned by Mr. Jann

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.760
is kind of a Czech problem

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:56.840
or if we could see or example the same problem
in Germany 

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:02.400
I don't know Mr. Breyer if you are aware
of this similar let's say story

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.560
As it was mentioned by Mr. Jann that

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.680
 a man came into
our prime minister office

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.840
and presented him the Excel sheet
with data

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.080
and then the lockdown begin

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.280
I don't know

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.360
Do you think that in Germany
this demand for the data

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.200
to provide better decisions is better?

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440
Mr. Breyer

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.960
Well the decision making in a democracy
of course is a political process, right?

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.640
And not a scientific one

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.800
So it would always
depend on various factors

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.920
and not all of them would be
scientifically viable

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.120
I agree with Mr. Jann that
we do have some knowledge

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.600
and recommendations from scientists

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.400
that could be used to make
those political decisions

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.960
about what steps to go 
and the lockdown, etcetera

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.560
And so there was not really a lack of

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.080
There could always be
a better knowledge but

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.200
I think it is good enough
to take good decisions

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.520
 and we’ve seen examples of countries
acting responsibly

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:15.160
and dealing quite well with the pandemic

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.480
But I’m concerned that

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.080
whereas traditionally

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:24.000
science has worked 
with experiments with volunteers

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.840
that there's an increasing hunger for 
what they call real world data

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.360
And real world data is, of course,
everybody's data

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:37.160
without asking people for their consent

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.000
And one example of that we’ve seen is

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.600
the mobile phone data

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.240
Which they are now probably anonymizing

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:50.600
to be able to, you know,
 tell people's movements

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.600
But even without the names

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.880
and even if you accumulate movements

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.880
This can easily be used
for different purposes

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.360
for example, the police or intelligence
agencies can be very interested

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.080
in where a large number of
people have assembled

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.000
at a given time

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.280
And they can then of course 
very easily follow up

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.120
with telecommunication providers 
and ask for the names

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.960
And ask, you know, who has it been that

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.280
Those 50 or 100 people that have met
in this place 

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.840
And maybe it was
a political coordination

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.200
maybe somebody planning a protest

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.680
and didn’t want the police
and the government to know 

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.840
And that’s why it's very tricky to get
the anonymization truly right

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.280
and even with anonymization
it doesn't mean 

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.560
That you cannot reverse it

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.480
and that’s why
I'm a strong defender for

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.000
for the approach to use samples

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.760
And to use volunteer data

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.160
and to keep people in control
of what happens to

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.320
 their information 
about their private life,

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.640
 about their medical conditions,
 etcetera pp

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.800
Thank you very much Mr. Breyer

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.640
I’m very sorry but our time is 
already over

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.160
Because

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.440
Yeah, the discussion was great

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.240
Thank you very much
 for all your contributions

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.920
Thank you for all the participants

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.160
 who were watching us for the whole time

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.320
and also commenting through the chat
