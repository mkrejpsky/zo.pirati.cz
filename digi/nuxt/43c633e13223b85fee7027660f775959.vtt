00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Quarantine economy

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.400
Good afternoon, welcome to the next panel
discussion of Going Digital 2020 conference.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.830
This panel is devoted to a topic
that is more and more interesting,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.000
given that we saw various
restrictive measures in last months.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.700
The first came in the spring,
the spring quarantine,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.000
and then we had a loosening of the summer,

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.680
and winter quarantine came
and we are now somehow dealing with it.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.800
We see that the economy will open again,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.250
so this panel is devoted to the so-called
quarantine economy or economy during quarantine.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.480
My name is Aneta Zachová,
I am the editor-in-chief of the euractiv.cz.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.150
I'm glad to be able to moderate
this panel discussion.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.350
I have great guests here,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.330
Mikuláš Peksa sitting next to me,
MEP for the Czech Pirate Party.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:08.565
Good day.
Good day.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:14.885
Online joined us Mrs. Danuše Nerudová,
Rector of Mendel University in Brno.

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:19.700
Mrs. Helena Horská,
Raiffeisenbank's chief economist,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.580
Mrs. Šárka Homfray, a lawyer and trade unionist,
also accepted the invitation.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.650
And Mr. Karel Gargulák, an analyst from EDUin.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.800
We have an hour-long discussion ahead of us,
so I will probably end introduction,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because I am very curious about
what I will hear from our dear guests.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Let's look at the first topic,
for many people the quarantine economy

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.320
means the transition from working in offices
to home offices.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.300
I wonder how this move to home-offices
or teleworking, as it is also called,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.280
how did it affect the economy?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.500
I would like us to talk not only purely
about the Czech one,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.020
but also to look at the whole European economy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.230
I'll take advantage of the fact that
I have two great economists here,

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:21.200
so first I'd ask the Mrs Rector,
if she could answer the same question.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.700
How did the transition from offices
to the home office actually affect the economy?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.100
Please Mrs Rector

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.880
Good afternoon,
I would like to thank you for the invitation,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.000
it is a great honor for you to invite me.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.150
As for how homeoffice has affected the economy,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.300
it has manifested itself in several ways.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.770
It manifested itself primarily
in what we all clearly observe,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.600
and that is that when
you look up at the sky, you don't see any lines.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.180
So this is one of the consequences of home offices,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.830
because I think that business trips
have dropped by almost 80 percent.

00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:04.241
I think the MEP could explain
how full the planes used to be

00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:07.100
because everyone flew to a working
meeting in Brussels.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.670
And now he's either driving
or sitting in a half-empty plane.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.240
So basically it has a big impact on traffic,
that's one thing.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.880
It certainly has an impact on the online economy,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.000
because when people moved to a home office
and spent most of it at home.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.270
Of course, thanks to closed shops,
the online economy sector is developing.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.600
And, unfortunately, it has consequences,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.575
we can discuss that, unfortunately,
as how it was set up

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:46.750
with the unfortunate settings and selection,
it happened that some shops

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.660
were discriminated against
and did not have a fair conditions.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.400
It will definitely have an impact
on the real estate market.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.980
The companies will significantly reconsider

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.000
how they will use their office space
for the coming years.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.210
Some want to reduce it, some will change
amount of employees with own office,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.165
or on the contrary some want to have
a higher standard, want more space

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:20.800
so that employees are separated from each other.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.800
Last but not least, I think covid means
that some myths have fallen

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.100
and that the resistance of employers
to send people at home office has fallen,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.700
because one big myth was
that people at the home office are inefficient,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.950
because they don't work, but I think this crisis has shown that in many cases

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.850
it is not true at all
and the efficiency is far greater,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.950
If all really went into those digital platforms.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.000
For me, it is one big change in transport,
in the real estate market

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.000
and, of course, it will also be indirectly
a change in the construction industry,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.450
because office space will be built
according to new standards and new patterns.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.250
Thank you very much for this introductory part
about how the transition to the digital environment

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.500
has affected our classic economy,
such as the real estate market.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.700
I would now have a question for Mrs Horská
and I would remain at this economic level.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.250
Mrs. Horská, can you tell us what positive effects
this transition had to the digital environment,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:49.450
to the Czech and European economy,
and whether we can learn from it for the future?

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.490
How to work in the coming years?
Please, Mrs. Horská.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.100
I also thank you very much for the invitation,

00:05:57.102 --> 00:06:01.600
I hope that we will have a very interesting
and fruitful discussion.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.850
As for the question, the positive impact
of homeoffice was certainly visible,

00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:14.600
because without homeoffice, we would be less
able to get covid-19 under control.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.930
However, it is necessary to realize that
homeoffice is not a model of work for everyone.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.700
I think it's good to realize.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.900
It is, as it is often said,
a possibility for white-collar workers,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.600
while blue-collar workers, that means,
people working in normal industrial production,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.900
unfortunately cannot benefit from homeofice yet, e
ven at this time

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.500
when we should move towards automation,
robotization and then digitization.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.450
It is necessary to realize that
in Czechia, according to the CERGE study,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.500
the home office regarded just a third of Czechs,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.360
which means that it is not even half of the people,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.300
and the home office was focused mainly
on large cities.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Especially Prague and large regional cities.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.000
So the home office in general, not only
in the Czech Republic but also in Europe,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.000
is also dependent on a certain degree of urbanization.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.430
It can be used in cities, but it is less
well used in industrial fields.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.200
Also there is difference in application of home offices
between economies that are more industrial,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.500
such as the Czech Republic but also Germany,
in contrast to other countries,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:44.000
such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
which are countries more focused on services.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.800
At the services, of course, we can imagine
that the home office is much more used.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.450
And another aspect is very interesting,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.150
homeoffice is rather offered
to people who have higher education,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.500
because they work in those fields
that are managerial,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.350
which are quite similar to services,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:13.390
or when they already work in an industrial enterprise
so they work in those managerial positions ,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:20.250
which may just be relocated somewhere
other than industrial production.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:26.100
So when we talk about home office, I would like to
emphasize that we're talking about Czechia,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.500
only about a third of the population

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.500
and it is necessary to consider
that two-thirds did not have this chance.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:41.300
That means saleswomen, drivers,
people standing at the production lines

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.850
did not have this option and had to find
other ways to deal with the covid situation.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:55.000
And I think that the good thing, as Danuše
has already mentioned, is the factor

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.700
that people have lost such shyness,
fears of home office and perhaps

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.800
even bigger worries about the home office
had employers, company managers.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:13.565
I have to confirm what the Danuse said,
in our bank the issue of home office

00:09:13.765 --> 00:09:18.410
was very much disscussed and I have to say
that both approaches appeared there,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:24.200
as the positive progressive approach that said
yes let's use home office,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.570
because by the way from the survey
we did among our employees, we know

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:35.800
that employee satisfaction increased
due to the fact that they were given a chance

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.180
to use the home office.
Again, not everyone in the bank got this chance.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.580
Unfortunately, we also have professions
that could not use the home office,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.350
for example people at the counters,
at the cash desks.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.450
But employee satisfaction has increased,
which is certainly good,

00:09:53.650 --> 00:10:01.000
but we also had managers who
opposed the change a bit, who were afraid

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.000
that in a way they would lose control of their employees.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.150
We also need to think about managerial skills,
how to educate managers

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.630
and how to teach people to manage remotely,

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.400
how to work with a team remotely,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.700
and I think that at this we have moved
really forward in a few months.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.650
and things we would have been doing for years,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:35.340
we managed in a few months due to the pressure.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.239
We had to implement the change

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:42.200
Even I had to learn to manage my team remotely

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:49.000
and I actually take advantage of these benefits,
from the new knowledge I learned.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.750
Acceleration of big changes that would otherwise take a long time,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:58.600
it means that from  business as usual,
we got into that acceleration

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.480
to the speed of changes.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.680
And I have to say that at work it was also
reflected in a change in the work environment,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.950
as Danuše said, that the design of the offices,
common areas, will actually change.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.100
It's not necessarily about needing more space,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.570
but we will use the existing space for
fewer people,

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:30.160
because we assume that maybe every
third person will take turns with a colleague

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.920
and the third will be at homeoffice.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.000
So there is really a change in the work
environment, in the organization of work

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.500
that we might experienced in the next five years,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.320
and now we will experience it in a single year.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.100
So the keyword is acceleration.

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:54.400
Thank you very much, Mrs. Horská, for this
really nice overview of the economic change.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.800
You were talking about the employees about
the large variety of people,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.660
who couldn't transition to the home office,
and stayed at cash registers or at production lines.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.750
I will leverage of the fact
that Šárka Homfray is here with us

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:17.850
and I would like to ask her if she thinks
that governments, not only the Czech one

00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:26.000
took care about these employees
during quarantine economy?

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.380
Please, Mrs. Homfray.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.400
Hello, I hope you can hear me well
and thank you for the invitation as well.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:45.000
Frankly, I don't think we were able to
take such good care of them as a state.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.150
We all know that, there was not enough
protective equipment in the spring.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.210
This was, of course, a worldwide problem.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:13:00.500
Unfortunately, I must say that many employers
did not buy enough protective equipment

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.600
for their employees even in the fall
when it was more available.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.900
Because truth is that

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:15.600
many employers have no legal obligation to
equip their employees with this equipment.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.500
Furthermore, we felt quite a great
reluctance of a number of employers,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.800
especially in the autumn,
to allow home office or work from home,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.100
even there where it was possible in the spring.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:38.350
There was a significantly lower will to
further measures such as dividing employees

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:47.500
into non-meeting groups, workplace
modifications, reduction of working hours

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.150
or a reduction in production, unless
the government measures forced them to do so.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:14:00.000
There are, of course, employers who did this,
for example, banks cut working hours

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.500
at their branches even though
it was not restricted, it was their will,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.540
but then there were a number
of employers who did not do anything.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.500
It was really clear that during the second wave
the will was even lower for any restrictions

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.900
than it was  in during spring.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:22.000
It must be said that this is not
remembered on this situations by our legislation,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.500
by the Labor Law or in other regulations,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:30.200
especially by those related to hygiene
related to safety during work.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:38.500
The crisis law, especially the enforcement of
violations of these crisis measures,

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.750
is not completely set for the situation
that happened.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.180
Inspection bodies do not have the capacity to monitor such things.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.500
It was not clear for many of those measures if
violations would be enforceable at all.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:59.700
So I have to say that maybe will or
at least there was an effort to

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:08.700
instruct the employers to provide
the employees, but the small enforceability

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:16.800
of the measures simply
caused that no one did it voluntarily.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.500
Thank you very much.
I would go a little further.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:30.500
In the quarantined economy, we are witnessing that some sectors

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:45.000
are facing huge losses, almost bankrupcy,
but there are sectors, who are winning now.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:53.330
Mr. Peksa, can you give us any
insight into which sectors within Europe,

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:58.600
in the context of what is happening,
are strengthening and if is it good or bad?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.780
We know it is mainly digital sector,
new platforms and applications are being made,

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:13.210
We have witnessed a digital boom,
do you think that this is a good thing?

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.960
Do you think it will last to future?

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:22.300
I would not say it good, because the process
or the transition that is going on now

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.580
is actually very stormy, very fast and
the change is very revolutionary

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.200
and many people suffer a lot because of it.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.510
On the other hand, as has been said here,
it is  a great acceleration of this process,

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.200
because we have had various programs,
such as Digital Europe and so for many years before

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.000
which were supposed to digitize Europe.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.150
Now we have basically got into the situation
that during the month we are in a position

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.200
that we must be digital, no matter what.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.000
So we started to digitize hurriedly,
because we had simply no other option left.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.400
I think it is true that some were
prepared for it,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.000
at the same time it is true that some
were tragically unprepared for it

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.000
nd they then had a big problem adapting to it.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.100
These processes change a lot,
it was seen during the first quarantine,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.750
when restaurants came under pressure
that they could not open,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:24.320
and they started to react relatively quickly
by cooking food and letting it be delivered.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.700
So I think one of those sectors that has
experienced a huge boom is delivery services.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.000
Although we will have to think about
how it works,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:43.800
because what I found out, the conditions
that employees have there, are often quite critical,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
but it is actually one of those industries
that was developing

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.580
and it was not so obvious before.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:55.000
I think a lot depends on the company
or on the institution.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.050
I remember, and it was mentioned here,
within the European Parliament

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.500
it was somehow the custom that everyone
just flew to Brussels,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.999
they all met there physically and
it was impossible to do otherwise.

00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:10.720
Then suddenly in the situation
when a package of legislation appeared

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.150
that had to be approved, or voted about it
and it could not be done in person,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.800
we began to invent alternative solutions
how to vote online.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.500
How to deal with these things.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:29.530
It was really very spontaneous, I would
often say that in terms of cyber security,

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.200
it could be done better,
but in the end it happened.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.300
Well, I think those who were right, said before
the crisis that it was necessary to digitize,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.700
modernize because they
were better prepared for it.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:50.000
For example journalists have asked me many times,
how the Pirate Party has dealt with this.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.250
We didn't notice it,
because we've worked online before,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.000
which means it wasn't really a change for us.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.999
We just kept using the same tools.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.700
I found out that somewhere else
they have magical problems

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.500
such as the resignation of the party chairman
nd they cannot convene an online congress

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.000
and they don´t know how replace him.
So they are in dead end,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.600
and they're still using the resigned person,
because they just can't get a new one.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.700
So it probably depends on what, how and where.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.700
I think we have realized that we have great
shortcomings throughout the organization,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:33.650
because until February 2020, healthcare
or preparation for these pandemic crises

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.000
was wholly considered the domain of the
Member States of the European Union,

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.800
So it means, when in March came the question
"so where does EU have maks,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.120
because we don't have any and where are
the warehouses from which you will supply us?"

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.800
So there were none. So logically
arosed the question where to take.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I am glad that we managed to
convince the European Commission,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.850
that it had started solving the problem,
so that sometime during the summer,

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:08.970
deliveries from central purchasings organized
by the European Commission began to flow,

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.700
although I think that even at this moment,
any European treatiet order this.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:19.420
It just does it because such a situation
has occurred and it just had to be.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:25.240
So I think we've just adapted in a number of areas,
and that adaptation will take place.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.800
It might be better to think about it in advance,
but after the battle, everybody is general.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.600
Thank you very much, we talked
about acceleration, about adaptation

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.100
and I think, that in this it will be
an important role to actually prepare it,

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:48.100
or, they should be prepared already, but
somehow to lead people to be able to adapt.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.200
Education plays a key role in this,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:57.940
I would as Karel Gargulák
from EDUin, who deals with education,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:04.310
and I would like to know if the current
school system, or the education system,

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:10.760
is actually ready for these changes that have
occurred in the European and global economy,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:19.250
if now Czech schools will be able to
produce graduates who will be prepared

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:24.000
or this relatively different reality
than was needed 5, 10 years ago.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.660
Please, Mr. Gargulák.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:33.200
Hello, thank you very much for the word,
I tried to indicate it in my first post,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:41.500
covid and the closure of the economy
slapped the system in the sense

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.010
that when we were talking about the potential of
automation and digitization 10 years ago,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.870
people have tried it now,
and tried what it means.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:57.000
It showed potentials of individual segments and sectors
for change within the organization of work

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.000
I'm not an economist, I'll leave all this
to Mrs professor and Mrs doctor

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.950
to talk more about it.
But what I would like to say is that

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:11.100
the interventions and the economic transformation,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.600
and the effects of closing down
individual businesses,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.800
can bring smaller segments to that, they close,
people will be unemployed,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.210
they will push them out of the labor market
and they will have to look for a new place

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.000
in it and that labour market will change.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:32.790
There must be a safety net for the public sector
with educational services in order for people

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:40.110
to be retrained, or to be able to acquire other
professions and find employment in that labor market.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.630
The public sector is not sufficiently
prepared for this role.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:54.200
Not ready because those schools would not care,
but there is not an assignment that would say

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.650
how the institutions should do it.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:07.500
And they primarily do not feel this need.
Because support for education is directed

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:13.020
a bit outside the education sector
and revolves around the employment office.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.300
Or around the own initiative
of large companies that are already working

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.550
on further training of employees.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.350
The primary role in this should be
played by those schools,

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.010
support and assignments should come.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:29.900
Support in terms of finance and in terms
of defining what we want and what new roles

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.000
these institutions should play. What should high
schools and colleges do in the new reality.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:45.380
And sharing the impact of the new, dynamic
economy that awaits us in the coming months.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:52.820
We have been slapped, now we are still
in the mode of economic subsidies,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.840
but in time they will end
and some sectors will fall to the bottom

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.200
and it will be necessary to continue
working with those employees.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:12.300
Public support will be need to be provided
so that these employees can find employment somewhere.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.160
That is the basic point,
I can bring to this debate.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.450
Thank you so much for this point.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.400
Again, I would like to invite the participants
of the discussion to write us comments

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.400
and questions so that we can answer them.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.450
I have the first questions from the audience.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.350
The question is about pouring liquidity
into the economy.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.180
Economists have strongly appealed to
the government,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:53.000
as whole economical sectors were being closed,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:25:03.000
to immediately release liquidity,
to pump money into the economy,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:11.960
and our viewers would like to know
how long we can work this way,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.100
how long it can last us,
let's say this pouring money into the economy.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.650
This is definitely a question for
our two economists in the panel,

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.700
I do not know if
Mrs Nerudova would like to start?

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.999
Thank you, I read that it was a question
aimed at me.

00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:40.200
I think it's necessary to realize, and
I must say I have goosebumps, when someone

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.120
says the word "pump",
because there was no pumping in our country.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.000
It is necessary to realize that
in comparison with other states

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.650
there has been no pumping,

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:55.500
I want to say, that all things are related.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.345
At the beginning of the spring crisis,
when was the lockdown,

00:25:58.545 --> 00:26:04.000
we said that liquidity needs to be brought
into the economy,.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.200
We pointed out that the state has
relatively simple, effective and cheap tools

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.600
to get liquidity into the economy.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.000
I must say that we were basically
not heard at all, because we proposed that

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:24.800
for example, to abolish the payment of VAT,
which is a very effective tool.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
It was a really big slap in the spring,
so we wre talking about the waivering of

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.350
social and health insurence payments for employers.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:44.300
I must say that the spring crisis has shown
that there is essentially zero state

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.650
confidence in businesses in the economy,
because unlike Western countries,

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.275
which trusted entrepreneurs and
really tried to help them effectively

00:26:52.475 --> 00:26:59.050
we have created incredibly complex
administrative tools that a lot of entrepreneurs

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.650
didn't get the help at all, or they got it
late, or they said to themselves

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.200
"it's not worth it, I'll help myself".

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.550
So, from my point of view in the spring,
the help came very late and the fact

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.850
that it came late was due to the fact
that there was simply no trust

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:20.770
n the business sector and we still did not
believe that entrepreneurs needed help

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.250
and the state felt more like
the help would be misused.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:30.800
So the excessive administrative burden
basically caused that the aid was ineffective.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.250
Then, when the economy defrosted and restarted,
the right manager should have

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:48.000
evaluated these tools,
their effectiveness and impacts.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.230
I have to say,
that unfortunately this did not happen.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:28:00.100
The second wave came and we pulled the tools
out of the hat again, thinking they worked.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.999
Yes, and at least they were
set up in time at the moment,

00:28:05.199 --> 00:28:08.400
but because they already existed
so they just were recovered,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.800
but we do not know if they were effective,
so maybe we can do something what is not effective,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.500
from my point of view is certainly not effective
to help with 500CZK a day to self-employed person,

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.500
who for example rents a hairdressing salon
and monthly rents cost 20 000 CZK,

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.000
so this help is really not effective
because it does not even cover fixed costs.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.800
And here it is necessary to say, just for
comparison, how the aid looks like west of us,

00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:41.636
so small and medium-sized enterprises
in Germany at this moment have

00:28:41.836 --> 00:28:48.400
aid that will receive 70 percent of the
turnover from November 2019.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.620
If restaurants in Germany are closed
till January 10, they will receive

00:28:53.820 --> 00:29:00.650
70 percent of their turnover in December 2019
as an aid in December 2020.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:06.000
So you feel from these numbers that the
word pumped can definitely not be used,

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.450
because the Germans are pumping,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:13.350
in our country, there is definitely
no pumping of help for entrepreneurs

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:21.200
And the question of how long,
the state should do everything to prevent

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.700
the economy from closing for the third time,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.430
but I'm afraid that just as
the train missed us in the summer,

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.480
the train again missed us at the moment

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.200
because the countries around us who
knew they have to build trace capacity,

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.370
that they had to build call centers
and testing capacity,

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.800
so today they know that whoeve
r inoculates the first, largest population

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.550
will be able to start economy
and will have no more losses .

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:54.700
This is not happening here
and we are preparing for third wave.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.650
And I call it the third, stupid lockdown,
because that lockdown might not be at all.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:04.450
If we were to building vaccination centers
at this moment, as they do in Germany,

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.400
so that the economic damages
would be as small as possible.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.180
So how long can it take?
Well, we will probably survive the third wave,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.750
but we will have a huge deficit, we will
have huge costs of servicing the state debt,

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:24.500
we will have a large debt,
if we get to 60 percent of GDP of total debt,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.500
then it must be said, that this debt will
definitely not be reduced by cutting expenditures.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.600
Truth needs to be told to the citizens.
if there will be a third wave

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.000
and we will have such a large debt,
so cutting expenditures will not change that.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.000
And there will come a time when we will have
to raise taxes and all of us will pay it.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.000
And among us, abolition of the super-gross
wage and that debt over 130 billion CZK

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.700
all of us will pay it as well

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.500
Just to be clear, it says it helps,
it doesn't help.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.250
Two-thirds of what is proposed
will go to high incomers

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.740
but we all will pay the debt,
in the form of higher taxes.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:06.000
So much for me,
I hope I somehow left room for Helena,

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.100
That I did not say all of it.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.900
Thank you very much, Mrs. Horská,
do you want to add something directly to this,

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:22.009
or do you think all important things
about pumping money into the economy,

00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:24.400
which did not happen, were said here?

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:31.260
I think Dana was exhausting and emotional
at the same time, because she's right.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.980
When we compare and promises versus actions,
I'm not surprised that those emotions

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.300
are so bubbling, because just the numbers,
I really like numbers,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.800
so I'll start with the numbers again,
and I'll probably stay with them,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.988
because Dana said everything needed,

00:31:49.188 --> 00:31:54.600
and the figures are such that aid was paid
to this economy at the end of November,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:01.000
not counting the purchase of Chinese respirators
and the rescue of indebted hospitals

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.450
unrelated to the covid and many other
expenses unrelated to the covid,

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.550
so the aid was also calculated
by the Ministry of Finance at 166 billion CZK,

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:17.100
that is 55% of the promised aid
in the amount of 289 billion CZK

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.200
and those loans which were promised
in the amount of almost 800 billions CZK

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.550
are drawn in units of percent.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.000
because the companies, when they needed
help at the most critical time,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.250
as Danuše mentioned, in the spring, did not
really get the help and they helped themselves.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:41.400
At the moment when the various covid programs
such Covic Plus, Covid EGAP, Covid Export...

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:48.200
were already up and running, which was
very late, actually at the end of the first wave,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.450
so the companies said

00:32:49.445 --> 00:32:53.920
"Ok somehow we managed it,
somehow we helped ourselves and it goes on"

00:32:53.921 --> 00:33:01.200
Perhaps what I would add to Danuše is that
the actually paid out aid was significantly lower,

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.400
I would agree that it was ineffective

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:10.200
and also it freezes, as Mr Gargulák
was talking about,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.650
it freezes the strucure of economy,
that outdated structure of the economy,

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:22.555
it means that it creates in our employees
and employers, ie companies, the feeling,

00:33:22.755 --> 00:33:26.700
that nothing will actually changed
and nothing has changed

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:36.000
and that we will then wake up to the original
reality and we start working in those

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.000
original works with original knowledge
and skills.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.800
And we will suffice until the end of our working life

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Unfortunately, the reality is really different,
because as it was said here before

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.300
and we should repeat it so that it gets stuck
in people's memory, there is acceleration here.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.240
There is an acceleration of changes
and it requires a great challenge

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.440
for employees, employers and the government.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:08.340
And it is a question of digitization:
being able to adapt for employees,

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.110
now we can see a change in working regime,

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:16.000
for companies a change in
work organization, new business models,

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.470
a new functioning of the economy

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:23.500
and we have a state here that
instead of reducing risk and uncertainty,

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:31.000
It is first week of December and
we do not know yet, what taxes,

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.000
we will pay from the first month
of the following year.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.880
We don't know what the conditions of the covid
would look like if another wave came

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.000
We don't even know
what next week will look like.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:48.850
So these are the challenges we face.
Without flexibility, ability to improvise,

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:53.950
our ability to improvise is amazing,
but I have a feeling that the government

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.300
is abusing it too much
and relying too much on it,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:03.210
so unfortunately it doesn't look very good,
but we've done worse, we can do this,

00:35:03.229 --> 00:35:08.000
but we can miss the train and I don't think
we should, it would be a great pity.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.400
Thank you, I don't know if you saw,
but Mr. Peksa was smiling next to me

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:21.470
when you were speaking, so I she would like
to ask, if he wants to add something.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.310
I certainly agree, because, as has been said,
the aid was very ineffective,

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:40.600
Fortunately, during this crisis, the European
response was more sensible than in the past.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.800
Because most governments have understood
what to do, which means that given

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:50.400
the interconnectedness of the economy within
the common market, we have been partly saved

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.800
because the others around us have behaved sensibly.
For example, the Germans.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.900
Because if they did it as badly
as our government did,

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.170
we were in worse trouble than we are now.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.800
Perhaps I would add a side note,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.950
I think that the answer at the level of the
European Economic Area, was spontaneous,

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.750
but was sensible,
but it was not coordinated in any way.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.800
As the Member States have been arguing
about what they will do,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.890
will do some rescue package,
and if they approve it at all,

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.700
so the whole process is not going effectively.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:44.000
We do not yet know whether we will have a budget
or whether Hungary will block

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.890
it for some internal Hungarian reasons.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:53.950
This is quite sad in my view, and we
should look for a way to make the management

00:36:54.150 --> 00:37:01.400
of the whole European economy work more
rationally, because as it is set up now,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.880
it is cumbersome and inefficient.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.570
Thank you very much,
I have another question from the audience.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:16.600
,I would like to ask Mrs Homfray about
employment.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:24.750
The question is, in the sense of whether
the financial evaluation of the functions

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:34.450
using home office or flexible hours,
that came with quarantine economy, will decrease.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Mrs Homfray, can you comment on this,

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:52.000
do you think that there is room for a change
in financial valuation in these sectors?

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:58.270
To be honest, I hope not.
I would not like someone's salary to be reduced

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.100
because they can work in the evening.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:07.500
Nor do I think that this should necessarily
be a reason for a reward preference.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:13.750
Frankly, what I hope is that whether
flexible working hours or a home office

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.150
will finally stop being taken as a benefit,
because that is not a benefit.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:21.250
It is an alternative work arrangement that
has its advantages and disadvantages

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:27.000
for both parties and at the same time
for each and every employee it does not have

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.460
the same advantages and disadvantages.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.150
So definitely take it as a benefit,
especially the home office,

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:39.000
it was really taken that way until the spring,
for a number of employers or the vast majority.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.120
Take it as a benefit, which like the icing
on the cake, I will allow someone to do it

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.000
he will reward me for it simply with
uncontrolled and immense flexibility,

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.150
so that by chance someone does not think
he does not work at home,

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.100
so I firmly believe that after this
year's experience

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.510
with this perception could and should be over.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:02.430
Whether this will have any impact on
remuneration or on the growth

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:13.622
or decline of specific wages for a certain
type of job, just time will tell.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.700
But there will be many more factors
that will now play a role in the growth

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.800
or decline of wage levels in
individual professions.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.440
We simply have segments of the labor market here,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.000
where it already seems, such as the hotel
and tourism industry,

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.850
that it may or already disappeared
up to 50% of jobs.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:39.000
and these people will get somewhere
onto some empty labor market,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.100
They will be theoretically qualified
in some other fields.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:53.000
So certainly the wage level will not be
influenced only by that flexible arrangement.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:01.300
I see that the interviewer asked if
the benefit would working from the office.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:08.500
It's also not a benefit, but honestly it is,
because the experience is not unequivocally

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.500
positive, as we are not prepared for it,
we were not prepared,

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.000
nor for the employers,
as it follows from those surveys,

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.400
and honestly for me it is no surprise,
because various researches,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.650
for example from Germany, where they have
more experience with home office and

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:28.640
and other flexible forms,
have shown that people miss those offices.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:35.475
They miss their colleagues,
they miss informal faster work matters,

00:40:35.675 --> 00:40:42.180
you really don't transfer everything to ZOOM
and other similar platforms.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:48.460
And isolation plays a role,
domestic factors play a role,

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:55.600
so I think the experience will be such that
and again I say the experience is new to us

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.300
but abroad they have already figured out
that the home office is nice,

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:04.750
it has its places. It's a good tool for
dealing with certain situations,

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:08.600
but it's not 100% all the time,
for all the work.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.340
in short, it is no win for any of those involved,

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:18.310
and that it will be approached in a helpful
but critical way.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:24.440
Thank you so much for answering the questions
from the audience.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.400
When we are talking about the home office
and the transformation of the economy,

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:36.700
we can actually observe the same in education.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:42.000
We had a panel directly devoted to education,
but given that education and the economy

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.100
are very closely linked,

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:53.440
I would like to know,
this would be a question for Karel Gargulák,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:01.150
how do you think the pandemic and
the onset of those homeoffices

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.210
can turn education in the Czech Republic?

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:09.000
Do you think that this leads to its
greater digitization,

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.600
and that even the actual digitalization of
education will lead to the fact,

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:20.350
that those school graduates
will be more digitally educated?

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.950
Please Mr. Gargulak.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:33.080
It was certainly stated in the last panel
that the average age of a teacher is 50,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.870
and for some of them the need to teach online was a big problem.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:43.200
On the other hand, it has improved
competencies, such as control of those tools.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.100
It occurs to me that the opposite has happened,

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:56.210
as everyone has realized the effects
of digitization, that it is not fiction,

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.260
and that it is a reality,

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.631
so everyone has realized
how important the school as an institution is.

00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:07.200
We realized how crucial it is that
children meet each other at school,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.430
the whole micro-society meets in one class.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:21.650
They learn to work together, to cooperate,
to share roles, to organize as a unit.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.800
These are important competencies,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.230
which are then useful in dealing
with situations such as crises.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:36.750
It's a trend against individualization,
when everyone will be at home,

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:43.200
alone and learning and it will be great.
So I think it balances the system.

00:43:43.237 --> 00:43:49.500
In general, when we look at those things
that relate to some digital competences,

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:55.333
the using of digital educational resources,
platforms, is a tool

00:43:55.533 --> 00:43:58.150
rather than the goal of that education.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:05.000
The aim of education is to develop
basic knowledge and skills.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.100
And those tools can be used for that.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.530
It helped those teachers
in the long-term project,

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:28.930
the Digital Education Strategy until 2020,
and it was not fullfilling at all until now.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.100
And suddenly it was such a huge leap,
in the context of building

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.670
those competencies of teachers,
to use, to master those tools, to be prepared,

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:46.850
that it flexibly pushed the whole area.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:54.400
Now we have two such key changes in the level
of primary and secondary education,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.740
which relate to the transformation
of computer science teaching,

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:04.260
which is already well prepared and structured,
but the terrain is not sufficiently prepared.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.600
And then it is using of those digital tools

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:15.875
to make it a means of acquiring skills
and knowledge in those other fields,

00:45:16.075 --> 00:45:19.175
such as the natural sciences, humanities etc.

00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:22.850
This is suddenly more desirable and
everyone understands it more,

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:27.900
nobody understood it before, but now everyone
has at least a general idea of what it means.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.540
This will help those changes associated
with the Strategy 2030.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.530
I ended with that strategy
in my introductory speech.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:43.100
I'm trying to find some more data here,
how it will look like with those executions.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.700
I have such a remark,
it was said across those panels,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.500
the competence of the public administration
to use its own administrative data,

00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:02.350
for being able to plan measures or use some tools,
is very limited.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.610
This is what the pandemic crisis has shown us,

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:09.450
it also applies to education, it applies
to all other sectors and segments,

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.382
and it is crucial to keep repeating it.

00:46:11.582 --> 00:46:18.700
It is not about swearing at the public
administration, that officials are incompetent,

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.280
it is a political task that is missing.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.180
Nobody pushes it,
because nobody understands it.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:31.480
The senior management in that public
administration doesn't quite understand that either.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.714
That pressure is important, from above
, the political assignment,

00:46:34.914 --> 00:46:42.594
and from below, through actors such as
the public sector, non-profit organizations.

00:46:42.794 --> 00:46:45.000
it has been very successful in education,

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.300
Or platforms that try to use
that data and interconnect it.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.000
The public administration does not easily
find the internal competencies

00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.150
and when it wants to find them, it often
outsources them, and it is not even advantageous,

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:05.400
because the public contracts and competitions
fall into the captivity of suppliers.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.480
And it is important to comprehensively grasp
it all  and somehow connect, symbiosize it

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.205
and create competencies
in that public administration,

00:47:12.405 --> 00:47:15.500
so that it can be then set up effectively.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:20.650
So we wouldn't have 150 unused billions,
or how many the doctor said,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.300
that were originally planned
to pour into the economy.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.200
In my opinion, they did not get there, because
the imagination of the Ministry of Finance

00:47:26.207 --> 00:47:31.520
is very limited and the Ministry of Industry
and Trade is not able to process it,

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.600
but that is the my opinion of a clerk.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:42.110
Thank you very much,
I see that Mrs. Horská is asking for a word.
So please, Mrs. Horská.

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:46.540
Thank you very much, I would be able to
follow up on the various topics

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.000
that have been said here.
So I would briefly at least to some.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:57.500
We were talking about sectors that were negatively
affected by the covid and some positively.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:03.700
We all know the positive ones such as,
e-commerce, online businesses, online platforms,

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:09.200
but perhaps little is known that
the digital economy

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.440
in the Czech economy already
makes almost 8% of GDP.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.000
This is a huge huge potential,

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.120
a huge counterweight to that other sector

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:25.520
that has so far been quite negatively
affected by the covid,

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.750
and that is the automotive industry.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.740
We keep talking about the Czech economy being
dependent on the automotive industry,

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.800
and rarely talking about it in the Czech
economy,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.400
digital economy already makes 8 percent of GDP

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.350
and has a tremendous potential to rise,
because during covid, and here again

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:49.090
I begin to use data from the McKinsey study
which was recently published, about Digital Challenges

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.600
and it shows that during the covid
in Central and Eastern Europe

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.000
there the rate of digitization of those
economies has risen by 50%

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.250
that amount of users increased significantly,

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:03.800
there has been an acceleration
in the number of clients using online,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.200
for example 7 out of 10 Czechs
are using online shops.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.200
It is people who did not even think
before about ordering food online

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.000
digitally and they are
using these services now.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.000
And most of them are going to
use this new skill further,

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.300
that means, we are actually educating people.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:29.250
It shows that the Digital as such has
huge potential for growth,

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:32.000
but we throw sticks under our feet.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.500
And this is exactly the non-digitized
state administration,

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:39.400
the inability of the state
administration to work with data,

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.400
meaning, to be able to collect data, to
structure data, to use them,

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.500
to make decisions on the basis of data,

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.400
but in every section in which
the state administration works

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.400
we always come across a problem.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.900
From the collection of data to their analysis,
to their aggregation,

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.000
to their processing and
to their decision-making based on data,

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.000
because it became clear during the covid,
that our government was not able to

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200
to make decisions at all,
or was not willing to make decisions

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:17.250
So we have great potential.
And just for the digitization,

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.220
I see that Danuše is asking for word,
so I will let her speak,

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:27.730
During the covid some sectors rapidly
moved towards digitalization,

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:31.200
It will probably not surprise you
but it was, of course, retail,

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:38.220
but it is also banking and if I recall correctly,
it was also telecommunications services.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.000
On the contrary, who was the least digitized,
and I was quite surprised,

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:48.200
were the travel agencies, which is very
surprising given what they experienced,

00:50:48.341 --> 00:50:51.560
but also the government
and insurance companies.

00:50:51.562 --> 00:50:56.150
So we see that, each of the sectors reacts
differently to these covid shocks.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:03.250
Taken together, there is great potential
to actually use the covid shock

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:07.500
to accelerate digitization,
but we must have prepared

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.600
infrastructure, institutions
including the government,

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.350
high-quality Internet connection,
and especially the prepared population,

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:21.000
employees, the workforce.
They must be prepared for the challenges

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.560
that await us, because we will
probably not do the same work

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:30.000
for the rest of our lives
and we will have to adapt to new challenges

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.300
and we will have to change occupations,
we will have to change our work skills.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.330
So that is my comments,
thank you for the word.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:43.000
Thank you very much, I saw that
Mrs Nerudová and Mr Peksa asked for the word

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.750
So I will ask Mrs Nerudova first.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:52.350
I would like to complete Helena
in the sense, that the accelerator

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:56.500
that we have now and leads to the fact
that, and in business, there is not much talk

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.000
about digitization,
but about digital transformation,

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.440
which is even a higher level.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.200
It is necessary to realize that while
business is doing digital transformation,

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.000
it creates digital structures,
it creates its digital twins.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:18.900
So we have a public administration that has not
even started the process of digitization

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:24.870
So the scissors during covid will open even more
than they were before the covid.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:29.250
Business and economics will completely
move away from that state administration.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:34.500
At this moment, the state administration
and its inability to digitize

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.800
create institutional limits
for this business,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.200
but the state administration
also creates them for itself.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:53.180
If the digital sector is 8%, at the moment
many companies have a digital structure, etc.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.900
and we have a tax system that is 30 years old
and at the time it was created

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.440
digital sector. didnt even existed

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:07.100
So it is quite clear that the state will not
be able to tax the digital economy at all.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:11.500
Therefore, many of those activities
take place in the Czech Republic

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.000
without the companies being
physically present here,

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.200
and the whole concept of our taxation
is based on that physical presence.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.100
We just can't tax
the digital presence in the country.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.300
We are talking
about an absolutely fundamental change,

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:29.550
a change of paradigm in the economy,
in all areas,

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:35.500
And our problem is, that we have not been able
to do basic structural reforms for 30 years,

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.700
and the accelerator accelerates the good,

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.730
but on the other hand it reveals that bad.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:47.680
It revealed this here,
and if we are not able to respond to it,

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.220
we will miss the train, but the most
importantly we will not be able

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.150
to fix the hole in those public finances.

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:58.850
I have been pointing this out for a long time,
it is a huge problem.

00:53:58.853 --> 00:54:04.053
and  because Mr Peksa is listening to us,

00:54:04.253 --> 00:54:08.000
so because we have the perfect tool here
the National Recovery Plan,

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:15.500
which should contain all these things,
transformation costs for the basic structural reforms,

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:21.820
and instead we are writing there
that it will stick budget holes and tax shortfalls,

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.100
this is completely unacceptable to me
and I am sincerely very happy

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:31.300
that there are people sitting in Brussels
who have written clear guidance on

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.900
on what in the National Recovery Plan is.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.885
And we think that somehow here,
forgive me the word, fool it.

00:54:37.085 --> 00:54:40.265
and that no one will know it,
but this time it will be known,

00:54:40.465 --> 00:54:45.650
because the countrie really give there
fundamental structural reforms and their costs

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:50.200
So I would appeal here,
if this discussion could open up

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.820
in public space in the Czech Republic,
it would be very nice.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:00.600
Because so far the plan means opening the
drawers and pulling out everything

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.170
that did not get
into the normal state budget,

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:08.000
and the second thing is that there is no
public discussion about it at all.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.300
That National Recovery Plan
is being created under a veil of secrecy.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:18.100
Have you read somewhere or did Minister Havlíček
talk transparently about the proces

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.700
of how it will be created,
where there will be some reviews

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:27.150
so that those stakeholders can enter into it,
or asked academics for some cooperation?

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:28.510
Nothing like this is happening

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.880
and I think that this is an absolutely key
opportunity for the Czech Republic.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:38.000
Thank you very much,
many things have been said here

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.350
that could be further discussed by Mr Peksa.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.500
There was mentioned the National Recovery Plan,

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.170
which means a kind of European aid
 to the national economies.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:52.000
We were talking about a taxation on 
the digital economy,

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.670
which is also a big issue 
for the whole of the European Union,

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.600
so please Mr Peksa,
 you may start.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.000
I will probably 
make a brief comment on the data,

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.200
what was said here about the data
 in the state administration,

00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:07.240
so I would fully sign it
 and add one more thing.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.200
The state administration 
must be able to work with them,

00:56:10.204 --> 00:56:14.050
and when it produces, collects 
and evaluates the data, so except

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:19.000
evaluating for its own purposes, it should
 publish it for the purposes of other actors,

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.290
because in the end 
the private individual could benefit

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.520
from having access to the date
 that the state collects.

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.525
It actually collects them for public money,
 so it is a public good 

00:56:26.725 --> 00:56:31.725
and there is no reason not to share it,
but it does not share it.

00:56:31.925 --> 00:56:34.800
It was a problem at all to get information
 about the number of infected people,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
information about what quarantine 
measures will be announced.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.200
Nothing was here, honestly
 I can't imagine how I would run a pub

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:46.120
without someone telling me if I should shop for
 next week because it will be open or closed.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.000
It was not clear
 and for those people it is a disaster 

00:56:50.087 --> 00:56:52.000
which is completely useless and pointless,

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.260
so I think that the data, shouldnt be 
just collected and evaluated, 

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.250
but should be mainly be published.
That data, which the state owns

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:02.200
Secondly, the question of digital taxation,
es, this is something we have been dealing

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.400
with for a long time, 
at least on the verbal level.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:09.000
It would be good to emphasize the direction 
in which the European Union is working.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.850
Here on the table were proposals that actually 
addressed the question of the taxation.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.800
simply said, we have a business in one state 

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:26.000
that  runs a digital business in another state
without being legally or physically present there.

00:57:26.034 --> 00:57:31.044
It makes money from it, this is something
 that creates a big imbalance

00:57:31.244 --> 00:57:33.900
in international relations,
 because some countries concentrate

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.840
those profits at the expense of others.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:41.250
It is necessary to address it, unfortunately,
we constantly encounter

00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:42.875
at the level of the European Union 
on the problem that,

00:57:43.075 --> 00:57:46.400
the tax issues are decided by unanimity.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:53.100
This means that if one state, which 
coincidentally profits from this mechanism

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.910
decides to block it, then it simply will not happen.

00:57:55.110 --> 00:58:00.000
We should probably wonder
 if the mechanism that one can block all,

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.860
is good and if it helps to solve it.


00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:09.150
Because obviously the solution
 to digital taxation is not happening

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:14.900
and as a result, some budgets of some states,
typically the Czech Republic, 

00:58:14.962 --> 00:58:17.300
are getting under more and more pressure.

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.400
And the last thing,
 the National Recovery Plan,

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.500
I would have signed it, 
I basically had to laugh

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.700
because I registered how the process was going.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.700
Incredible things were happening there,
 the ministry was leaking information

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.400
like they don't really know,
 what projects they should do,

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.000
so they will just repair all the bridges 
in the Czech Republic no matter what,

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.100
It doesnt matter, that it is not needed,
because what else would they spend it on?

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:43.390
Another big problem was that very little was 
consulted with counties and municipalities.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:47.700
And in fact, the information about what
 would be needed at regional and local level,

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:50.510
did not get up to government at all.

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:54.200
And then, of course, the process of 
that internal comment within the government

00:58:54.137 --> 00:58:56.600
 was completely unimaginable.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:03.500
On Friday, they brought a plan from
 the inter-ministerial comment procedure,

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.650
which should be handed 
to the government on Monday,

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:08.822
it did not arrive at all, 
and the minister sent it to Brussels,

00:59:09.022 --> 00:59:11.150
saying that it doe not even have to
 be approved by the government.

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.300
The ministers even were not able to vote about it,

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:17.700
because they simply could not agree on it before.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:26.700
And in this sad way, 
the government's plan was being prepared,

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.600
so I think we actually need
 a far more participatory way

00:59:31.698 --> 00:59:35.200
of how are these economic strategies formed.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:40.800
It's just the way, how is it created now,
that someone just writes it from the table

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.700
and it's supposed to be
 applied in the whole country,

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.100
so I'm afraid this just can't work.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:48.100
I think that in those other countries
 they understood it

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.300
and I think that there will be a
 lot of pressure on the Czech Republic

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.360
to, in some sense, innovate its processes 
of its own internal decision-making,

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.300
because like, let's face it, 
no one will send money from the outside

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.400
to watch it be thrown out the window, 
it's just not politically bearable,

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.300
we can't defend it if we say 1000 times
that we are defending the state interest

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
or the national interest,
 it just doesn't work.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.400
Thank you very much, I'm very sorry,
but I have to end this discussion,

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:20.000
because it's already 5pm, we could 
certainly discuss about it for hours and hours

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.000
specifically about the National Recovery Plan,

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.200
which is also a very interesting topic
for me, which I try to cover

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.000
and I see how difficult it is, because 
it is not entirely easy to get information.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.350
 I would like to thank you  
many times for a great discussion.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:38.320
I hope that some of the appeals 
that we heard here,

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.700
that we will be able to get somewhere further.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.000
We'll see, so thank you so much.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:56.260
We have another program, now I would
 ask Šárka Homfrey to stay here with us,

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.250
because now she will have an interview
 with her colleague Klára Votavová.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:06.550
So definitely don't leave the computers yet and hold on with us.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:10.350
We can be looking forward 
to the interview with Šárka Homfrey

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:14.800
and then we have one more panel 
about the future of digital democracy.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.250
Thank you very much 
and I wish you a pleasant rest of the evening
