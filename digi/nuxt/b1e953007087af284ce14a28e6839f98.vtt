00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Disinformation during the pandemic

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Good morning everybody

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.800
As I said in the previous part, first panel 
opening today´s conference Going Digital

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.394
is about disinformations, specifically disinformation
 in the time of global pandemic of Covid-19

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:26.000
Before introducing guests and discussion,
 let me say few organizational things,

00:00:26.674 --> 00:00:32.000
Whole discussion shall be on 60 minutes 
and shall be dived into 2 main parts.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.000
In the first part there is discussion
 about 3 main parts, subtopics.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Subtopics regarding disinformatio
n during Covid time.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.810
And whats is it about? We are going to talk
 about most frequent disinformations,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.000
information narratives: 
who is spreading them and why?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.830
How it affects our society and 
political environment.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.900
And also how to defend
 and is it even possible to defend that?

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.810
In the second part of discussion we are going to
 take a look on viewers questions

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.440
I hereby appeal to you, the audience,
 who are watching us, you can ask questions,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.190
but please be specific of person who you are asking, 
to avoid everyone answering your question.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.700
I will also ask you to turn off your
 microphones and cameras.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.560
Before we start discussion, I would love to introduce
 our panelists who are here today with us.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.350
In the first place I want to welcome Mr. Jakub Kalensky,
 who is analytist of US think tank, Atlantic Council.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.470
Specifically he is part of program 
called Digital Forensic Research Lab.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:57.620
In the past he also was in EU team´s East StratCom
 Task Force, which was dealing with
 disinformational campaing and hybrid threats

00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:06.481
I also welcome here Marketa Gregorova, 
member of European Parliament of Pirate party,
 also Vice-Chair European Pirate Party,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.671
who deals with hybrid threats, disinformations 
and cyber security in European Parliament.

00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:23.800
Next who I welcome here is Alžběta Bajerová, 
who same as Mr Kalensky, is not physically present here,
 but we can see them on monitors.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Mrs Bajerova is analyst of 
Association for International Affairs.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000
She also operates in Brusel, in NATO's HQ,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.390
where she also works as analysist dealing with 
disinformations and influential operations in Transatlantic area.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.710
At last but not at least I welcome here
 Mr. Zdeněk Strnad, chief editor of Flowee City.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.900
Welcome here everybody
 and lets move to discussion.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.600
As I said before, at first we will discuss 
the most frequent disinformations

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.820
and disinformative narratives about COVID-19
 we can meet and see on Internet

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:10.630
and who is spreading them
 and what is their motive?

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.180
At this point I would like to ask Mr. Kalensky
 if he can enlighten us, with his expertise.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.890
What narratives and disinformatins 
about Covid-19 do you perceive,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.000
who are the most common disseminators 
and what is their motivation?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.940
Thank you for invitation, the most common narratives,
 why they are being spread and disserminators.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.070
That is a thing for hour long talk. 
So I will try to summarize that into 2 minutes.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.640
The most common narratives will be heading
 to who is responsible for that virus or pandemic,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.320
is it as serious as official sources claim
 and how to solve it.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.610
So you will be questioning whole existence of the pandemic,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.080
you will be questioning creation that in China.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.950
Instead you will be saying that this brought US Army
 who is responsible for worlwide spreading.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:28.940
You will be fabricate nonsenses about organizating that
 by Bill Gates to put microchips in brains via vaccination.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.180
which we have there already from previous
 pandemics, from different people.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:45.590
According those desinformaters you will be spreading
 lies about how to solve this pandemic.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.590
How to cure this disease.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.810
The whole thing has just one goal,
 to undermine the West,

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.430
undermine institutions, including solid media,
 governments and their institutions.

00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:06.990
This partly answers to the questions,
 who is spreading that.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:18.200
The main informative aggressors are Russia and China.
 They feel to be in coflict with the West.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:26.320
they want to choose mostly information means,
 not military means

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:39.150
so they use the information sphere to actually weaken the West
 at all levels at which they are able to do so

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:49.930
And one of them may be to questioning that
 you have to trust the government, WHO or your doctors

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.610
about how serious it is and how to deal with it.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:02.810
Of course, then as the actors here have a strategy
 and they know what they are doing,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:09.120
unfortunately, 
it is simply  law of information confrontation,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.930
rolls a pile of useful idiots in our environment, 
Ilona Csáková or Roman Šmucler,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.500
but of course you would find them in every the language space, 
someone who will repeat the nonsense

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.400
and they will not know that they serve as 
useful idiots to some information aggressors.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:33.390
So thats briefly from me and I would let speak 
other speakers. We can explain details later.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.600
Thank you, you mentioned several levels of those
 disseminators, from state actors to useful idiots.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.099
I would now like to ask Mrs Markéta Gregorová
 about the motivation of these disseminators,

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:54.609
Mr Kalenský also mentioned China as a state actor
 who is actually trying to change the overall narrative,

00:06:54.809 --> 00:07:00.159
that China is not the source of the virus, 
on the contrary, the source of the virus are other countries,

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:04.919
that China is successful
 in fighting the virus and helps everyone.

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:10.269
What do you think, has China been successful?

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:16.200
Successful in this effort to change this narrative
 and what do you actually think about their motivations?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.600
Why is China doing it?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:28.000
Thank you for the question, I'll start with
 those motivations,  because I just think it's important
 to mention that motivations can be different.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.200
as we may be used to, primarily from Russia, 
for example, but not only that.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:44.110
It is often a matter of weakening that trust in the institutions,
 of what is true and of undermining democracy
 or a democratic establishment.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.640
In reality, however, China has slightly different
 reasons for its disinformation campaigns and what it does.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:08:01.680
And that is, technical and scientific espionage
 and also the ambition to be the scientific, technological
 and business leader in the world.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:09.110
To do this, of course, 
it needs the most positive image possible,
 for people to believe it, to like it.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:15.800
to want to make business deals with it,
 to want to sell it something or buy something.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.880
It is not just about ideology, 
but also about good old money.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:36.490
That's why China's trying to get into that position of savior,
 and that's how I get to your question 
about if China was successful.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.410
Of course, we do not have data from
 all countries, whether global or European yet.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:51.200
However, where China began its largest
 disinformation campaigns in Italy,
 we have data and China was succesful.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.240
Chinese so-called Mask diplomacy,
 as it is now called, has caused it.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:03.180
China actually supplied protective equipment
 and similar things to Italy for free

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:11.680
and spread information there about how China is helping 
and how the virus doesn't come from there at all.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:21.070
It caused that before the Mask diplomacy
about 10% of Italians had somehow
  a positive attitude or opinion of China,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:29.200
now it's 52% this is an extreme increase
 and at the same time 
we have evidence of how much it was disinformations.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.000
On Twitter, for example, it was very interesting
 to watch which hashtags were followed.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:47.490
Hashtags #GsoChinaandItaly and #forzaCinaeItalia, 
over 46% of posts were created by automatic bots and not real people.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.930
even so, it had such a big impact 
about a 42% increase in chinese popularity.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.040
We can say that at least 
somewhere China was successful.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.000
China knows how to use propaganda
 and misinformation,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:08.600
unfortunately because it has had many years of testing at home, 
so we need to focus more on it and learn to fight it.

00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:13.350
Alžběta Bajerová, 
you also work as an analyst at NATO in Brussel

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.000
and also as an analyst,
 the Association for International Affairs

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.010
from what Markéta Gregorová talked about,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:28.640
could it be deduced that the spread of disinformation
 and disinformation narratives by a power such as China

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.300
poses a certain security threat,
 and within the geopolitics of the transatlantic region.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:43.480
Do you perceive that threat? 
Are they successful in threatening in Transaltantic region
 by spreading disinformations and disinformational narratives?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.240
Thank you  for the question and for the invitation.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.490
Certainly, information operations by state actors
 pose a threat to transatlantic security.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.000
And I think we saw it best right now 
with the covid-19 pandemic.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:05.610
At the same time, an infodemia arose 
that prevented to states from making an effective
 response to what was happening.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:13.530
We must say that those crises, such as the pandemic,
 are a breeding ground for all disinformation

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:20.000
when people's attention to covid news
 was extremely high,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.500
and especially in the first wave, 
the demand for information exceeded the supply
 that official sources could provide.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.000
So people often turned to alternative sources.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.000
This is something we will probably
 see with each subsequent crisis.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:42.400
The actors of those information operations
 took advantage of this and did not produce
 a large number of disinformation articles,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.500
but all that disinformation infrastructure
 was straining to cover just covid- 19.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:58.400
And these actors used covid as a carrier
 of what Mr Kalenský and Mrs Gregorová
 have already mentioned here.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.400
So that they can deliver this traditional 
light motive of all information operations.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.340
That the institutions, the media 
and our democracy cannot be trusted.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.000
But it must be said 
that the responsibility for that infodemic,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.700
massive spread of disinformation, 
among the masses and into the mainstream,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.240
we can't just blame those information operations.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.000
The biggest spreads 
of disinformation during the covid period,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.000
as now confirmed by independent research
 from Harvard, Oxford and Kings College,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.560
were domestic politicians and the mainstream media.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:39.080
Politicians in the pandemic often relied on disinformation
 when they were in line with their political views.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.800
And after the mainstream media had to communicate
 what they were saying so they spread the disinformation.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.820
And here I want to follow up on what Mrs Gregorova
 said about the spread of misinformation in Italy.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:13:01.900
Where researchers from Merck said 
that the botnets on Twiter did not have 
the greatest influence on the Italian public

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:07.680
but the politicians themselves, 
who promoted the disinformation flowing from China,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:15.360
because they joined China in the Belt 
and Trails initiative last year,
 so they've been helping a lot now,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.810
that China is sending some aid 
and they have inflated how China is helping.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.320
At the same time, the media had to inform
 about what politicians are saying.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:32.000
At the same time, it focused a little on aid
 from China and Russia, it was exotic

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.000
and it was a bigger topic than aid coming from the EU.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.000
To the statistics quoted here,
 I would just add that, at the same time,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:48.250
70% of Italians feel that the EU has failed
 to help Italy and respond to the corona virus.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:54.000
Which is an even more important number.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.100
So to sum it up, the most dangerous
 is the convergence between

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.000
the disinformation infrastructure
 and the mainstream, politicians or the media.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.200
Here I would turn to Zdeněk Strnad
 as a long-time journalist and now chief editor,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:18.420
Mr Strnad, do you feel to some extent responsible
 for refuting disinformation as a journalist in the relevant medium?

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:28.240
In your opinion,
 should the traditional mainstream media
 refute the disinformation, or is it someone else's job?

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.000
And another thing you wrote,
 among other things, if I remember correctly

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:40.110
an article mentioning that disinformations 
and fake new news are nuclear weapons of the 21st century.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.750
Can you explain what did you mean?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.480
First to the second question

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.825
the article I wrote
 in which it was written that disinformation

00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:59.999
is the nuclear weapons of the 21st century
 is based on a simple premise

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:09.770
The purpose of  every war
 or conquest of a territory

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.240
is actually to obtain resources
 which are in that territory.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.279
whether they are natural resources, 
people, whatever

00:15:19.479 --> 00:15:23.999
If you fight for a territory
 by traditional methods,

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:31.719
the ground war or so,
 then there is some damage in that territory.

00:15:32.207 --> 00:15:35.999
There is  damaged infrastructure
 or casualties and so on.

00:15:36.213 --> 00:15:38.783
but when using disinformation as such,

00:15:39.055 --> 00:15:41.965
So if you are doing it very intelligently

00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:49.204
and given the budgets of those states
 we are talking about,

00:15:49.404 --> 00:15:52.064
devoted to spreading disinformations

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:57.400
and  colleague mentioned here,

00:15:57.223 --> 00:16:00.000
for example, the influence of China, 
here in the Czech Republic,

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:06.300
So given how much money goes
 into those disinformation campaigns

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.216
and how, as has already been said here,
 with those subjects

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:15.449
that are now beginning to
 spread disinformation and financing it,

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:18.188
trying to gain influence as in that territory,

00:16:18.388 --> 00:16:25.330
so it is quite obvious that when you use that disinformations

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:30.576
so the influence and access to resources you can get

00:16:30.776 --> 00:16:36.046
without damaging things you dont want to damage.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:40.800
and now I would like to ask on the first question,
 how exactly was it?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.770
Because other speakers mentioned

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:49.420
that the medias are to some extent
 responsible for refuting the misinformation.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:58.000
It is very difficult especially 
when we take into account the situation

00:16:58.001 --> 00:17:03.450
that arose from the beginning of the year 
due to the covid pandemic.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.030
There was a huge social isolation of some groups,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.635
and I was working a lot with seniorsat the time.

00:17:10.835 --> 00:17:14.100
There the problem was absolutely the most striking.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:23.000
Dozens of chain mails circulate in these closed groups,

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.000
in which the information 
spreads completely uncontrollably

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.390
unlike social networks, which are used  
by other groups of the population,

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.921
but there is actually almost no public control.

00:17:35.007 --> 00:17:43.727
and it is important to realize for what purpouse
 or which are credible sources of informations.

00:17:44.073 --> 00:17:48.793
Each of those groups has some sources, 
this has chain emails.

00:17:49.074 --> 00:17:55.900
Some simply follow certain websites, 
certain groups on social networks and so on.

00:17:56.168 --> 00:18:01.000
and the information circulates in these closed 
groups or in those channels and circles.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.800
However, there is one channel that everyone, 
no matter how his credibility is questioned,

00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:16.200
it still has enormous credibility in the eyes of the public,
 of all the public, of all age groups,,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.942
and these are the public medias.

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:25.000
which, as I said, despite all the criticism,
 still have enormous credibility,

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:31.270
so I think that their role in today's world

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.200
and the current information situation 
and completely irreplaceable.

00:18:34.095 --> 00:18:40.999
I personally I think their importance
 is also the reason why such a war is waged against them.

00:18:41.199 --> 00:18:44.200
The very last thing I get is 
to what you asked first.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.600
if I feel responsible for it as chief editor.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.999
Of course, I feel responsible within our readers and

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.400
I think that this is the task not only 
of the chief editors of the local medias,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.648
and people who work there

00:18:55.848 --> 00:19:01.011
but actually all people who simply 
work in public space in any way.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.500
or even among your friends,
 among the family actually

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:11.300
everyone should be responsible for that within
 those people who can simply influences.

00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:17.000
Due to the fact that
 I am the chief editor of a magazine

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:22.500
that reads a number of people, 
so I definitely feel the responsibility

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.600
I feel a responsibility
 for this within us and honestly

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.900
I'm a little ashamed when it is taken 
as  journalism, or journalist to journalism as whole

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.700
because what some colleagues produce

00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:43.300
it is sometimes hair-raising.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.756
And the last thing I think there is a completely
 significant and huge influence of the family.

00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:58.500
Because children who are, let's say,
 far more sensitive to those fake news

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.034
or let's say children and teenagers
 just as we say young people.

00:20:03.234 --> 00:20:09.474
At least from my point of view, 
as well as adults who perceive some media as authorities,

00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:15.061
in my case the public medias, so I think
 that those teenagers and children

00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:20.000
there is influence of a family, 
which up to a certain age

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.100
considers a completely irreplaceable authority.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.630
Probably thats all for the beginning, thank you.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So I will follow up and address Jakub Kalenský,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.500
Mr. Kalenský, you talked about influential 
operations and disinformations

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.700
and their impact on society in the US Congress,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.573
and you are trying to make 
the Euro-Atlantic area a better response to

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:43.300
disinformation and its impact on our society.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.130
The question is simple.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:52.800
How do you think society, politicians or media
 should fight againts disinformations?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.500
What is the way to fight them?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.760
First of all, it is necessary to accept
 that it will be a more options

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.700
and not that it will simply be the right option.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.700
Sometimes you hear different people
 in that information space

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.940
saying that one thing will solve everything.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.330
Either we would have to accept
 that this one solution is simply not enough

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:26.000
or we would aim for a higher level of media literacy
 than is still available to humanity in 2020

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:33.030
It seems to me more rational the first possibility 
that we need a larger range of those solutions,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.740
not just one solution.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:42.000
And that we finally need to do more 
and think less about if we are doing something

00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:47.402
One thing we really should learn 
from those Russians and Chinese

00:21:47.602 --> 00:21:52.800
they're not afraid to make mistakes. 
They are just acting

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:04.200
and are not afraid to use a relatively primitive
 but centuries-tested method of trial and error.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.500
They are just trying to spread the information.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.500
The channels and the messages 
that work for them are repeated,

00:22:12.687 --> 00:22:15.200
nd if something doesn't work for them,
 they look away from it.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:21.400
On the contrary, since 2015, the European Union
 has produced 70 different documents

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.800
on the topic of how to deal with disinformations

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Basically, we're still looking for the perfect 
solution instead of finally doing something.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.530
There are only a few individuals
 from the European institutions,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.620
who works every day instead of thinking
 about what would be good to do

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:44.660
I don't know what it's entirely that maybe 
it's because those information Aggressors

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.900
have a little more such morality 
or adaptive thinking

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.800
towards conflict situation while we'd still
 like to pretend that there is no conflict

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.999
and that we can talk from it.

00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:08.219
The moment we turn these two fundamental obstacles
 that prevent us from reacting to it effectively,

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:13.100
or reconciling with the fact that different
 audiences need different solutions

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.970
and reconciling with 
the need to do more, talk less

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.800
and that we have to come to terms with it.
 that  we will make mistakes.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.620
So then we have great opportunities
 to do everything

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:33.950
I have been trying for some time to talk about 
such four basic lines of defense against disinformation.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.400
The first one is completely primitive

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.000
We  need to more document,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.340
our big problem is that 
we still don't have a complete picture.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.230
We still do not know
 how many disinformations information aggressors

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.500
are spreading every day and how successful they are.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.400
The honorable Member has spoken
 about the opinion poll in Italy.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.400
We would need opinion polls
 that measure the success of disinformation

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:07.990
every quarter of the year for all 27 Member States
 or ideal for the whole of Europe.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.360
But if you asked me, who spends 
60 to 80 hours a week with this problem,

00:24:13.632 --> 00:24:18.999
how many people in the Czech Republic
 believe that Skripal poisoned himself

00:24:19.199 --> 00:24:23.389
or that MH17 was shot down by Ukrainians,
 I won't tell you. I dont know.

00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:26.300
And that's the problem that we don't even
 know  the exact extent of the problem,

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.153
but then we are badly creating solutions.

00:24:29.353 --> 00:24:34.500
The 2nd line of defense is raising 
awareness of what the threat is.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:41.800
Mr. Strnad talked about the fact that 
medias can inform more  and I think they can

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.600
I'm  glad that some media
 do it in the Czech Republic,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.770
I think maybe Denik N, RespeKt or Aktuálně,

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.051
they quite try to do it on a regular basis
 which is great.

00:24:56.251 --> 00:25:00.161
I have even noticed the Eurozpravy 
that it is trying.

00:25:00.162 --> 00:25:01.700
That's great and I'm glad that some media do,

00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:03.600
but on the other side, 
it would certainly be possible to do it more.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.120
We can't think that only media will solve this.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.690
I'll talk about what Mr. Strand said,
 we just have the problem,

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:13.800
again, disinformators know it,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.999
Different audiences 
receive information differently.

00:25:17.199 --> 00:25:22.200
We have to count with the fact
 that some Mr. Balda

00:25:22.222 --> 00:25:26.660
somewhere near Bruntál 
simply will not consume Aktuálně or Respekt.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.030
We have to find the channel
 that speaks to him,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.830
and again these disinformers can do much better 
than we can. Just by trial and error.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:42.850
They don't really hesitate to open offices 
in all the Scandinavian countries

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.600
and close them in a month
 because it doesn't work.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:54.600
Because Finns do not need to read in bad Finnish written
 what is happening in Ukraine.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.780
So they are trying some different channels.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:05.061
The third line of defense and
 the correction of our weaknesses, such as media literacy,

00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:08.231
and it is related to those social networks

00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:10.501
I don't consider them to be bad guys, on the other hand,

00:26:10.701 --> 00:26:15.721
they could do a lot more so 
that the disinformations don't spread there.

00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:23.464
The fact that YouTube is able to recommend
  to viewers in recommended videos Russia Today,

00:26:23.664 --> 00:26:28.900
it's just as if Tesco offered you heroin
 at the cash register.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.060
I just dont get it, how is this possible.

00:26:32.438 --> 00:26:35.800
And the 4th line of defense and 
that's something we do very little,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And it's a thing where I'm slightly happy 
that it was written into the European democracy action plan.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.250
We must punish those information aggressors,

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.830
and we can't just tell the victims of information
 aggression, prepare better next time.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:58.570
We don't deal with crimes like this,
 we don't tell Breivik victims, you should have run faster

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.000
and you should have bought better armor.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.900
No, we're trying to arrest that Breivik 
so he doesn't shoot people anymore.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.580
But since 2015, we have done nothing
 at all to nor Russia nor China,

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.900
and for their information operations
 to bear some unwanted costs.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.555
Until we change the mindset here,
 they will continue.

00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:20.565
And as long as they continue to do so,
 they will have results, so the 4th line,

00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:27.135
I would probably say
 that it will be the most important there.

00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:33.900
If we don't do it then all three of the previous lines
 may just be wasted.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.770
I thank you, Let me just specify
 that just yesterday

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.000
the European Commission issued 
the so-called Democracy action plan

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.200
and there is proposition as one of the possible
 solutions to combat disinformation

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.000
the possibility of imposing sanctions on subjects

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.380
who purposefully and systematically
 spread such disinformation

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.700
so it is such a new thing that may be
 transformed into a legislative act

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.999
We are slowly approaching 
to the middle of the panel.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.989
I just want to appeal to the audience,

00:28:03.189 --> 00:28:07.250
if you want, in the chat you can ask 
any question to our speakers,

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.800
and then we will be nearing 
the end of this panel,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.880
your questions will be answered, so dont be afraid
 to ask questions in the chat.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.700
I would like to ask Marketa Gregorová,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:26.070
Mr Kalenský talked
 about the influence of disinformation.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.000
I will specifically 
ask about political influence,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.400
because you are a Member of the European Parliament
 sitting in the Legislature of the European Union,

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.900
how do you actually feel that political influence
 there through disinformation campaigns?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:44.710
Whether its the views of your colleagues
 from other factions or the amendments they put forward,

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.500
how do they feel about the various
 legislative proposals of the commission

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.500
do you feel the influence 
and results of disinformations?

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.200
So I will,  
although I am here in the European Parliament

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.500
to start a little bit from the Czech level,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.000
because I think that we 
and everyone here actually see the influence

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.000
and even more the political one,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.660
because we have witnessed demonstrations  in Prague.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:14.320
Here we have seen how you can start
 a wave of solidarity at the beginning of a pandemic

00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:17.600
when everyone sews maks 
and is encouraging others to handle it,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.401
and when the 2nd wave came,

00:29:20.601 --> 00:29:24.000
of course, not only through disinformation 
and government´s behavior,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.300
but also due to disinformations regarding the
 effectiveness of those protective equipment

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.000
or the danger of the virus,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.480
and suddenly solidarity
 and sewing maks becomes resistance.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.800
Not believing to the government
 or other experts saying.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.300
and of course the political impact
 of the demonstrations.

00:29:47.588 --> 00:29:53.588
Which now may seemed like only
 a part of society feels it that way,

00:29:53.788 --> 00:30:00.000
in my opinion, this will be reflected especially
 in the elections next year, to the parliament,

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:01.919
and true impact comes out.

00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:11.859
The European level is something
 little different because what the EU

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:17.979
can do and has autority during through pandemic,
 was mainly some cross-border cooperation

00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:22.339
and coordination of the transport of 
protective equipment or other materials.

00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:26.800
Then, of course, financial aid 
 and there I must say that from the beginning

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.600
there was a relatively large solidarity

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.000
and a relatively large effort to obtain
 as many funds as possible

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.171
for those funds of economic recovery
 but also for the purchase of protective equipment

00:30:40.371 --> 00:30:42.637
to countries where second wave hits harder.

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:45.500
And after all, we as the Czech Republic also felt it,

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.200
when, I think lung ventilators,
 we were provided with this fund.

00:30:51.193 --> 00:30:58.999
So I would say that I did not see the political effects
 so much that the solidarity persisted there,

00:30:59.199 --> 00:31:01.469
but I think that each individual member state,

00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:06.800
not just the Czech Republic,
 felt the political effects individually.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:11.200
And it can also have very long-term 
and long-lasting consequences

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.260
and the way how our democracy will remain strong.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.537
Thank you, now I would like to
 turn to Alžběta Bajerová.

00:31:21.737 --> 00:31:26.800
Regarding disinformation during a pandemic, 
which is the main topic of this panel

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
that are definitely related health risks

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.800
because if we spread disinformation 
and narratives such as covid doesnt exist,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.400
don´t wear masks and so on.
 It ceirtanly has health effects

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.750
and health risks can also be life threatening

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:46.400
You, as an analyst for
 the Public Affairs Association and NATO

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:53.030
do you see these health risks, 
and is there really any evidence

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:58.840
that disinformation does have an impact
 in this area of health and

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.610
affects human lives and human health?

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.000
Thanks for the question

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:08.900
complex data and some clear statistics 
and does not yet exist,

00:32:08.877 --> 00:32:14.900
but I think we can see the primary 
and secondary health effects.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:20.600
The direct effects are, for example, 
when 700 Iranians died of methanol poisoning,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:27.700
after trying to distill the alcohol
 that was said to be able to cure covid.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.500
It is an example of some 
disinformation about treatment,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:38.700
sounding seemingly innocent, 
can result in the deaths of 700 people.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.400
Another direct effect will certainly be
 the disinformation regarding vaccinations for covid,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.290
which is already growing.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.000
I think that the moment vaccinations start,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.250
we will definitely see 
a second wave of disinformation,

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:58.800
when people will unnecessarily die
 because they refuse to be vaccinated.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.467
Secondary effects then are 
when people do not follow the measures

00:33:04.667 --> 00:33:09.227
because they do not believe in covid,
 and this causes next spreading.

00:33:09.427 --> 00:33:14.800
Which then has the cumulative effect 
when hospitals are full and so on.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.800
The direct effect of disinformations 
can be extremely harmful,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.800
we can also see it outside healthcare.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.600
For example in the USA an armed man
 broke into a restaurant in 2017,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:33.999
because he firmly believed that the Clinton family
 kept there and abused small children.

00:33:34.199 --> 00:33:41.241
In the UK, dozens of 5G towers
 have been destroyed by people,

00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:43.711
who believed the 5G is harmful.

00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:48.751
According to the survey, 
only a small percentage of people in the UK

00:33:48.752 --> 00:33:51.900
trust alternative media, compared to the US.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.500
But this small percentage is enough

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.140
for the effect of disinformation
 to be really harmful.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.000
The potential threat to
 those information operations

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:10.300
is, that those groups of people who are so 
deeply convinced of this disinformation

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.710
can be weaponized from a distance.

00:34:12.595 --> 00:34:14.700
Weaponize by targeted disinformations.

00:34:14.633 --> 00:34:19.103
for example, for destroying
 the critical information infrastructure,

00:34:20.534 --> 00:34:23.600
and something like this could be used,
 for example, in conflict.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.470
Now I would like to ask Zdeněk Strnad

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.500
and I will actually follow up on Mrs Bajerová

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
regarding the issue of creating
 some social bubbles,

00:34:35.047 --> 00:34:38.777
either on social networks 
or on the Internet as such.

00:34:38.977 --> 00:34:42.300
When, for example 
we have a social bubble of refusers of vaccination

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500
and they simply do not leave the bubble because

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.200
they confirm each other in their truth and

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:54.250
dont want to hear other alternative opinions 
or are not inclined not to listen to them.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:58.890
Last year, you took part
 in the successful Day Offline campaign,

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.500
which, by the way, 
also drew attention to the consequences

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.090
of addiction to the Internet and social networks.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:09.700
Why I am saying it, do you think 
that our dependence on social networks

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:16.200
is actually one of the consequences of
 an addiction and creating of social bubbles

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.210
that are just impermeable?

00:35:18.294 --> 00:35:21.600
And do you think 
that if we disconnect us more from the Internet

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:28.500
would the bubbles start to burst a little 
or do you have a different opinion?

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:34.400
You are saying "disconnecting from the Internet",

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:43.900
so to me, frankly,  it's like a situation
 that I don't even consider,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.000
because disconnecting 
from the Internet is something, in my opinion,

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.900
like inventing Time Machine.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.830
The campaing Day Offline, 
you were talking about was not just about

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.999
disconnecting people completely, but first

00:35:58.979 --> 00:36:03.489
tried to balance
 their approach to social networks.

00:36:03.689 --> 00:36:06.000
in order not to live only in the closure
 in those one bubbles,

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.770
on the contrary,
 to get out of those bubbles, they drew information

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.500
also from other sources 
because returning to those social bubbles,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.500
is basically certain regardless
 of those social bubbles

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:26.700
arise arise on the internet 
or whether they arise simply in real life

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:32.940
because before the influence of the internet,

00:36:34.281 --> 00:36:37.800
when noone was Facebook or elsewhere,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.500
was going to work, to pub and had family.

00:36:40.624 --> 00:36:44.200
Those were three social bubbles at that time.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.117
But how to get out of this, 
I would like to mention one more campaing.

00:36:47.317 --> 00:36:52.300
In this year's coronavirus period,

00:36:52.500 --> 00:37:03.248
we actually started a show, on one 
regional television, called Prague for Seniors.

00:37:03.448 --> 00:37:11.047
one of the goals was to spread information
 among one of the most endangered groups,

00:37:11.247 --> 00:37:13.517
which in this case were seniors.

00:37:13.717 --> 00:37:17.957
Who, as I say, do not believe
 what is in the official media,

00:37:18.157 --> 00:37:22.396
chain emails with  an incredible amount of
 disinformation are shared among them,

00:37:22.596 --> 00:37:24.297
There is no control in that.

00:37:24.567 --> 00:37:36.527
How you convince any social group 
that you want to tell them something?

00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:40.300
And they should give some importance on it.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.100
Well, you have to interpret it in a way
 that they believe,

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.200
and because one of the biggest 
arguments that speaks

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.800
for the truth of certain information 
is when someone you trust tells you.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.559
So we were thinking about 
who these people would trust,

00:37:56.908 --> 00:38:00.000
who is the one, who enters their bubble

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.999
and at the same time is important for them.

00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:10.100
So after a long deliberation
 we chose a moderator named Saša Hemala,

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:17.000
Everyone from this group knows him.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.708
He was announcing news and informations

00:38:21.908 --> 00:38:26.500
about what it looks in Prague
 with current supplies.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.000
It was a show that ran three times a week,
 had a relatively high audience.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.600
And when Mr Kalenský spoke about

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.800
how this should be reflected in the media.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.190
This is one of the ways in which the media,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:49.010
regardless of their size and reach,
 could fight it.

00:38:49.555 --> 00:38:56.800
Think about the need and specifics of people,
 who you are talking to,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:08.310
think who is the person 
who will speak to them through your medium.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.659
learn to speak their language,

00:39:10.663 --> 00:39:13.363
thats's incredibly important.

00:39:13.563 --> 00:39:17.103
then you have some chance

00:39:17.303 --> 00:39:22.800
that you will somehow slow down
 the crazy flow of disinformation.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.500
if not stop it.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.800
It's hard job, there is no universal recipe for it,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.050
just the personal responsibility of everyone,

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.100
whether it's a parent,

00:39:35.286 --> 00:39:39.100
or it's a person who has the opportunity to
 influence the content of a media,

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.350
or whether it's an ordinary citizen.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.500
I think the principle is the same

00:39:42.481 --> 00:39:44.741
maybe just like that the degree 
of responsibility is various,

00:39:44.774 --> 00:39:46.300
depending on how many people you influence.

00:39:46.169 --> 00:39:50.500
Jakub Kalensky, you mentioned
 both the Democracy Action Plan

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.700
but also the responsibility 
and a certain role of online platforms

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.300
specifically mentioned by YouTube.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.810
Do you think that the Commission is trying,
 in the Action Plan for Democracy,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:08.200
to ensure that, in the future,
 online platforms would be more regulated?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.500
and they have more responsibility
 for fight againts disinformation?

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.400
Do you think that this is the right way
 that there should be EU regulation

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.300
that would bind online platforms like
 Facebook, Twitter or Tik Tok and so on.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.999
to really be looking for
 disinformations and deleting it?

00:40:26.199 --> 00:40:28.333
Isnt it close to censorship?

00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:30.500
Who will decide what is true and what is not?

00:40:32.702 --> 00:40:34.082
I admit that I probably don't have a completely

00:40:34.282 --> 00:40:38.502
strong opinion on regulation or non-regulation.

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:41.900
It's not like I want to avoid an answer.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.800
It's not that I'm not knowing the topic,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.200
but I'm actually still not sure if it's a good idea
 or if it's not a good idea.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.500
It is clear that the so-called
 self-regulatory principle,

00:40:54.457 --> 00:40:58.377
which the European Commission
 chose sometime in 2016/2017,

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:05.200
turns out to be almost useless.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.600
In its own documents, 
the commission always admits that,

00:41:09.603 --> 00:41:11.999
the platforms have shown us activities

00:41:12.199 --> 00:41:14.500
that actually do nothing about
 the spreading of disinformation

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.200
and always, as every month,
 Commission threatens them,

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.000
if you don't get better next time
 so we have to think about regulation.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200
Thats being said over two years.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.600
Which seems to me to be that the level 
of solving the problem is not entirely high,

00:41:28.693 --> 00:41:31.100
but I'm not really sure.

00:41:36.301 --> 00:41:41.500
Maybe we should think about that a little 
in the style we think of the medias

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.999
I think how often is there a debate about
 whether social networks are actually publishers,

00:41:50.988 --> 00:41:52.200
they are publishing information or not.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.600
I think, gradually shows that, yes, they are.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.170
I think, for example, 
the recent US election showed it a bit.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:04.600
while until then, Facebook 
and Twitter always washed their hands

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.350
and were saying we don't really interfere
 with what is spreading in our networks

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:12.900
and we only deal with such 
coordinated inauthentic behavior.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.200
so suddenly as soon as 
they indicated that Donald Trump

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.800
was lying about winning the election
 or lying about those falsifications,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.890
so they showed us, that they care nor just 
about unauthentic behavior, but also about the factual level

00:42:26.876 --> 00:42:28.700
Which I quite like,

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.700
they came up with it themselves
 without any regulation,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.969
but at the same time 
I admit that it's not certain,

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.800
that the networks will do it for us.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.600
That "who will decide",
 I will admit that the question,

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.600
although I have been listening
 it for several years,

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.480
I don't really like it.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:55.200
It suddenly makes from the truth
 some personal property,

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.100
and I am deeply convinced
 that there is no personal property in the truth.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.300
Old scholastic definition 
speaks of adaequatio rei et intellectus

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.030
as a harmony of what you have
 in your head with what is outside.

00:43:08.306 --> 00:43:10.000
Thats a process of searching.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:15.530
You are searching if
 whats is happening between your ears

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:19.000
matches what's going on outside the brain.

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:21.999
I think that everyone
 here simply has to be an arbitrator,

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:24.100
which should not mean,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.600
That the networks or platforms or any other
 actor will not have the responsibility.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.070
After all, the platforms can also decide,
 that they have some responsibility,

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.200
and in that case of Donald Trump,

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.000
they obviously said it to themselves
 and they decided.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.500
this is just something we're going to refute,

00:43:40.432 --> 00:43:43.300
and I'd even like to see them do this more often.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.300
I think that here each of us 
will have the responsibility,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.000
whether it's at the level of the individual

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.600
or at the level of a huge company like Facebook.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.680
I don't mind at all
 that if they take it on their own.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.650
Of course I will be happy if they do it
 in cooperation with renowned fact checkers

00:44:02.616 --> 00:44:06.200
and non-profits who have been
 doing on this for years

00:44:06.167 --> 00:44:08.700
and its plenty of them.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.099
if they have the will it will not 
be difficult to implement,

00:44:13.213 --> 00:44:20.200
but I don't think we just have to look for
 someone outside who defines it for us

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.800
instead of us so we can wash our hands
 and say we don't really decide

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.330
what's true or not.

00:44:24.983 --> 00:44:26.800
We should accept the responsibility

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:39.285
I think it's up to each individual, every medium
 to decide where the boundaries are.

00:44:39.999 --> 00:44:45.459
We can push them to have those boundaries 
where we think it is right.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.500
For example, 
as for the pandemic of the corona virus,

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:53.500
Facebook went the way of self-regulation 
and maybe changed its algorithms

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.800
and prefers messages 
that are currently issued to authorities

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.310
such as the WHO. Ministry of Health and so on.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.700
This may be one way to go.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.800
I would say that in this was 
Facebook or Twitter quite successful.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.830
Markéta Gregorová regarding
 the Commission's future legislative proposals

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.800
on fight againts disinformation,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.700
you will co-decide about them
 in the European Parliament.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.400
What is your point of view,
 should online platforms be legally responsible

00:45:20.419 --> 00:45:23.799
and regulated in the sense
 that they should actually search for

00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:25.289
and delete disinformation content?

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:29.269
Or the Union and the Member States
 should go the way,

00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:32.500
as Mr Kalenský said, of analyses,

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.800
data collection and gaining more information

00:45:35.702 --> 00:45:38.400
about how those narratives work
 and how they are spread.

00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:41.999
For example, the European Union has
 recently started operating in

00:45:42.199 --> 00:45:45.249
so-called European Digital Media Observatory (ATMO).

00:45:45.449 --> 00:45:49.800
which is about to work with both
 academics and fact checkers

00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:52.300
on the analysis of disinformation.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.600
What is the right way?

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.540
Well, as Mr. Kalenský has already said,

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.300
This is a million dollar question,
 but of course I must also agree with him,

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.600
as he said at the beginning,
 that we must stop standing still
 and start doing something

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.800
Often people are asking me, 
if we are losing the fight against disinformation

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.200
and I am always replying
 that we haven't started fighting yet.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.300
We have no legislation.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.611
We don't have any proper tools 
or anything that would really push it forward.

00:46:21.811 --> 00:46:25.600
Anyway, to what is the best answer,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.200
it probably won't surprise anyone

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.900
that I'm not completely enthusiastic 
about some self-regulation of networks,

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.400
but that's because it's not a question. 
Should that be regulated?

00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:38.800
There will be regulation. 
It's about who will be responsible for it and

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.800
who will be the leader of it.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.800
We are currently throwing
 that responsibility on social networks

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.200
ecause we have a legal vacuum 
in this regard and no one knows.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.500
But even the networks themselves
 do not want to have that responsibility.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.600
In my opinion people think, for example, 
that Google and Facebook come to me lobbying

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.200
asking to not change anything.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.700
No they are lobbying
 that they desperately want some regulation,

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.500
because they are terribly unhappy about it.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.900
They are companies
 that are based on earning profit,

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.470
and that is their main goal, why do they exist.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:13.800
It's not because they really wanted 
to make society better

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.400
or more connected 
but because they make profits from it.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.800
Well, we can't really expect social
 responsibility from such companies,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.900
but the fact that they will try
 to behave in such a way

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.000
that they have more and more satisfied users,
 who will bring them further profits,

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.900
whether from advertising or anything else,

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.240
and that is why we should not let
 them regulate themselves,

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.700
because what will happen, is that they will
 only censor more and more

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.600
and deal more and more what
 correct content they have there

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.650
in order to have those satisfied users there,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:48.900
on the contrary,
 I think that governments should emancipate

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:54.200
I prefer to be EU on our continent

00:47:54.245 --> 00:47:58.000
and, of course, governments 
and finally dive into it.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.200
Now I'm talking about the short-term approach.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.000
There is of course long-term one 
with lots of steps, media literacy or so,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.100
that I take as granted

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.800
but at the same time
 and that's my last point in this.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.600
It's not that the government should
 determine some dreaded Ministry of Truth

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.700
and regulate platforms.

00:48:15.877 --> 00:48:19.187
It's about the balance of who he is doing what

00:48:19.387 --> 00:48:25.950
and I think we forget that balance
 is quite beneficial in the triangle.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:30.400
We forget about civil society,
 the truly independent organizations

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.200
and people who can control and support it.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.280
At the moment it is set up so
 that there are some organizations

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.160
which are being hired by the platforms.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.650
We can trust them or we don't,
 but it is just about trust.

00:48:45.676 --> 00:48:49.662
But if is there balanced triangle

00:48:52.662 --> 00:48:55.392
and it will be supported by governments,

00:48:55.592 --> 00:48:59.400
and respected by democratic controls, 
that it is independent

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.000
and the platforms will be encouraged
 to hire these agencies

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.010
and they will  do fact-checking 
or checking the information

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.600
and mark and show,
 not necessarily censored.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.830
Just to show, that information is not true.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.250
So I think we can get to a point
 that is neither the censorship

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:19.500
but also not doing noything,

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:24.200
because both are, in my opinion, 
very harmful and we must go in some direction.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.200
Thank you, since we still have 10 minutes left,

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.120
I would quickly turn to the questions
 that landed in the chat,

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:39.110
There is question which aims at Jakub Kalenský
 from Mr. Dominik Voráč

00:49:39.222 --> 00:49:44.000
"In your opinion, disinformators are winning
 because we are only thinking

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.370
while disinformators are acting.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.200
but isn´t it also about that,
 that defending against disinformation

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.440
is much harder and more difficult 
than creating and spreading disinformation?"

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.690
Thanks for the question,

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.000
because I thought we wouldn't
 get to that question,

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200
so I was answering it in the chat.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.500
So I will briefly answer here.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.300
I completely agree with the premise 
that spreading disinformation is easier

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.550
than defending against them.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:18.550
I think that's exactly what
 we should adapt to in a situation.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:23.800
After all, we profess the same
 principles in the physical space

00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:25.900
as opposed to the information space.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:33.300
If it is easier to rob people
 than to defend against someone stealing us,

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.999
so we simply set laws 
and restrictions so that it is more difficult.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.700
If it is easier to spread a toxic substance

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:47.200
than to make sure that none of the
 inhabitants spreads any toxic substances,

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:51.500
we simply set up such mechanisms
 so that it is more complicated.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.502
Yes, it is of course easier 
and it is up to us to solve this situation.

00:50:58.702 --> 00:51:03.800
Surely there was a time 
when there were no traffic regulations,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
people probably died because of it.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.460
Then someone said 
that there are too many cars

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.999
so we should have some regulations
 for how we will move on those roads.

00:51:18.199 --> 00:51:22.800
Maybe we are really approaching the time
 when maybe those regulations will really be necessary.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.670
That information space has evolved to a time 
when it is already quite complicated.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:29.410
It's not as easy as it used to be.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.400
Governments and the big media no longer 
have a monopol on the information situation.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.000
We have new subjects here
 who don't really have the mechanisms

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.121
as media or goverment have.

00:51:41.321 --> 00:51:44.121
We probably must adapt to the situation

00:51:44.321 --> 00:51:49.681
and we have to reckon with the fact
 that there are bad participants

00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:54.731
or aggressors to whom 
we simply must make it difficult

00:51:54.931 --> 00:51:59.000
and not lettim them spreading 
disinformation with impunity.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.000
We have three minutes 
so I would ask Alžběta Bajerová,

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.940
she was a member of the analytical 
project ChinfluenCE

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:11.999
within the Association for International Affairs,

00:52:12.199 --> 00:52:15.300
which is of course dealing 
with the influence of China.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:16.600
and thus I will follow up on Markéta,

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:24.600
who spoke about the fact that
 China is successful in building that narrative.

00:52:24.639 --> 00:52:25.800
What do you think,

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.500
is China and its hybrid threats
 and disinformations, threat for 21st century?

00:52:32.674 --> 00:52:37.794
Certainly, those state-sponsored 
information operatitions,

00:52:37.994 --> 00:52:42.144
these which are linked to China,
 they have most resources.

00:52:42.344 --> 00:52:48.800
At the same time, the information
 operations coming to Transatlantic area

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.690
are not high quality. 
Mainly because language barrier

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.160
and there is also a cultural barrier.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:03.090
The narrative that is now spreading 
and is very positive about China

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:07.030
is quite recognizable to us, 
as Europeans, as propaganda.

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:13.170
so I must say that so far 
the direct effectiveness is not so high,

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:18.489
rather the risk that currently 
represents Chinese operations lies

00:53:18.689 --> 00:53:26.600
in connecting those elites on messaging of China.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.150
However, in the future, it can be assumed

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:31.750
because of those massive resources,

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:36.690
that the quality of operations 
resulting from East Asia will increase.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:39.620
So I would certainly call it a threat.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.000
Unfortunately, our time has passed,

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.200
So I want to thank you for your participation
 and thank you for being here with us,

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:47.062
even though you couldn't be here
 with us physically but at least online.
